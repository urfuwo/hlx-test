      <div>“The power of coming together to deliver change.” It’s a driving philosophy of 2023 SAP Innovation Award winner <a href="https://www.sap.com/idea-place/sap-innovation-awards/entries/2023-award/submission-details.html?idea_id=3517">WEConnect International</a>, an organization devoted to helping female entrepreneurs by using technology to help them compete in a global marketplace. It’s a mission I relate to on a number of levels.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>As SAP’s vice president and head of Diversity &#x26; Inclusion in North America, I’m proud to oversee numerous talent development and career advancement programs for women and other marginalized, underrepresented groups, programs that will help them excel today and prepare for advancement tomorrow.</p>
  <p>Having been an entrepreneur myself, I remember the challenge of not having access to information that would have opened up my business to a range of possibilities. Systemic change drives impact over time and SAP is committed to changes fostering gender parity and equitable opportunities for all. We are very proud of that!</p>

  <p>From a deeply personal standpoint, I understand that women have to excel at what we do in the world and must contribute back to society, leaving it better for the next generation.</p>
  <p>This was the general theme of SAP’s recent Live Chat on the Tomorrow’s Tech Today platform. I was honored to be a guest, along with Elizabeth Vazquez, president, CEO, and co-founder of WEConnect International. We’d met earlier this year at SAP Sapphire, but SAP and WEConnect International have been partners far longer, as our Global Sourcing &#x26; Procurement organization leverages the organization for supplier diversity purposes to drive global spend with women-owned businesses. Additionally, most recently it developed a platform assisting women-owned businesses across 135 countries. Together, we discussed how inclusion is more than just the right thing to do, but a business imperative for the sustainability of our society.</p>
  <h2 id="the-revolution-will-be-inclusive">The Revolution Will Be Inclusive</h2>
  <p>SAP’s Live Chat on Tomorrow’s Tech Today platform is a new, limited series hosted by thought leader Sally Eaves, highlighting the latest innovations in emergent technology integration across a range of sectors and themes. In each episode, SAP innovators come together with experts from a variety of backgrounds, sharing stories that can inspire all of us. While each organization may differ, each interviewee shares their version of the same story – overcoming a unique challenge with the type of innovation we all aspire to achieve.</p>

  <h2 id="the-great-equalizer">The Great Equalizer</h2>
  <p>In the United States alone, 42% of all businesses are owned by women. These employ more than 1 million workers.</p>
  <p>Not only are women half of the population, but we make or influence 85% of all consumer purchasing decisions. With that scope and buying power, having a platform to enable success is critical to the economy as well as society. But there are so many challenges. On average, corporations, governments, and other large organizations “spend only 1% with women-owned businesses, and that’s a massive market failure,” Vazquez pointed out.</p>
  <p>Legacy platforms helped aggravate the situation. WEConnect International’s member-buyers found it difficult to search for women-owned suppliers, while the businesses struggled to navigate their systems to register and apply for certification. Language barriers created the predictable complications. On a business-to-business (B2B) level, many women-owned businesses were small and midsize and not even on the radar of the larger corporations. The platform would serve as an equalizer for buyers “to go online and search for these competitive solutions that, frankly, our buyers just didn’t even know existed,” Vazquez said.</p>
  <h2 id="like-minded-like-kinded">Like-Minded, Like-Kinded</h2>
  <p>One advantage WEConnect International enjoyed in launching its platform was the list of influential partners, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), ExxonMobil, Accenture, IBM, and Procter &#x26; Gamble (P&#x26;G). And not only was SAP playing a key role in building the platform, we are also member-buyers.</p>
  <p>In other words, we were “like-minded, like-kinded,” walking the walk, talking the talk, truly committed to leveraging our purchasing power to realize this goal.</p>
  <p>The solution, dubbed WECommunity, would stand as a great example of <a href="/topics/diversity-inclusion">inclusion</a> by design.</p>
  <h2 id="art-of-the-possible">Art of the Possible</h2>
  <p>By connecting member-buyers to a database of more than 16,000 registered or certified businesses, WEConnect International broke through the barriers that previously existed. The streamlined process enabled an additional 7,900 women-owned suppliers to register with the organization. These included businesses from 12 new countries, a 28% increase in global reach. The revenue growth of the suppliers has led to the creation of 24,000 new jobs.</p>
  <p>Since deployment, WEConnect International went from tracking US$4 billion in spend with women-owned businesses based outside of the United States to $8 billion.</p>
  <p>“Together we’re actually moving money into the hands of women who, in turn, employ more people and support their families and communities,” Vazquez said.</p>
  <p>With those types of results, it’s clear to see why WEConnect International embodies the spirit of SAP Innovation Awards. Through its use of SAP’s tools, the group has created not just a platform, but a vision of the art of the possible.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is the first technology to give individuals maximum control over their digital persona – and it’s as simple to use as a social login. Businesses will benefit too.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>At the moment, we identify ourselves online in one of two ways.</p>
  <p>Typically, we sign into an online service – a Web site or app – using an e-mail address or username and password, and in doing so share some of our personal information. With this method, whenever we switch to another service we have to repeat the log-in process with a different password. This leaves fragments of our data behind on each service we use and forces us to create and remember a different password for each one, which is annoying but essential for security reasons.</p>
  <p>The more convenient option for initial log-ins is to use a “social log-in,” such as your Facebook ID, which allows you to use the same username and password to access a variety of different services. With this one “federated identity,” you can complete your initial log-in to a participating app or service by simply selecting “Sign in with….”</p>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="understand-how-sap-respects-and-protects-individuals-privacy-rights">Understand how SAP respects and protects individuals’ privacy rights</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/about/trust-center/data-privacy.html">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The downside of this convenience is that your personal data – and that of millions of other users – is controlled by a single company, creating honeypots of data that hackers have often successfully targeted in the past. There are many examples of sensitive information being stolen, including address data, medical data, credit card details, and more. Aside from not being ideal from a <a href="/topics/data-privacy">privacy perspective</a>, most people would probably not feel comfortable using a social log-in to access a sensitive service like their bank account.</p>
  <p>But there is a third option. Self-sovereign identity (SSI) – also known as decentralized or portable identity – allows users to identify themselves on the Web using credentials stored in a digital wallet on their smartphone. It offers the same convenience as a social log-in, but the user is in full control of the data.</p>
  <p>“This technology is not owned by a company,” says Mehran Shakeri, development team lead at <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/company/innovation/icn.html">SAP Innovation Center Network</a>. “It’s the first completely open standard for digital identity on the Web, and it gives individuals maximum control of their data when deployed with a proper registry.”</p>
  <h2 id="user-friendly-id-technology--for-businesses-too">User-Friendly ID Technology – For Businesses Too</h2>
  <p>Companies and organizations can also use SSI technology. After all, they also have an identity – usually in the form of a public entry in a commercial register. For example, when logging into a business network, a supplier must share a range of data, including its tax number, IBAN, and postal address.</p>
  <p>Currently, this data cannot be automatically verified. Entities created in internal systems must be verified using a relatively complex and costly third-party service. Records can be inconsistent and difficult to keep up-to-date. Data is often transferred from one system to another without being automatically verified.</p>
  <p>This major issue can be solved if a company has a self-sovereign identity. Its digital wallet then serves as a single, vetted source of truth and there is no need for an external third party to verify its credentials.</p>
  <p>This opportunity for a “golden record” of master data extends beyond company boundaries. “At SAP Innovation Center locations, we have projects in progress with DATEV, the Dutch government, and a host of other customers to validate use cases with SSI,” says Alexander Schaefer, head of SAP Innovation Center California. “We see tremendous potential in integrating the SSI standard into SAP software.”</p>
  <p>This technology would eliminate many of the identification processes currently in use, some of which are highly complex. Anyone who has opened an account with an online bank knows just how many steps it takes to prove your identity. With SSI, all users have to do is scan a QR code with their smartphone to share the relevant, verified credentials stored in their digital wallet. This digital wallet can be on their phone or laptop, for example, as a browser plug-in. The wallet is secured by common authentication mechanisms such as FaceID or TouchID, which have proven to be very secure.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="trusted-authorities-can-issue-credentials">Trusted Authorities Can Issue Credentials</h2>
  <p>For SSI to work, individuals need a digital wallet containing credentials that have been issued by a trusted third party – such as their driver’s license, MBA certificate, or tax ID. An empty wallet is useless. Trusted authorities that hold this type of data can issue the relevant credentials, which is why it is so essential that these entities adopt SSI.</p>
  <p>Among the many companies that can issue these credentials, German IT service provider <a href="https://www.datev.com/about-datev/">DATEV</a> was one of the first to embrace the concept. “Together with DATEV, we have demonstrated how self-sovereign identity enables seamless business processes across ecosystems. Transactions from all parties are digitally notarized and tied to their cryptographically verifiable credentials,” says Schaefer. With decentralized identity, master data of organizations becomes trustworthy, which can ensure that companies communicate with verified and trusted partners in the ecosystem.</p>
  <p>Before we can all be issued with these credentials, however, SSI technology needs to be widely adopted. Shakeri is confident that mass adoption will come. “There is hardly an industry that would not benefit from SSI,” he says.</p>
  <h2 id="ssi-as-a-driver-of-transparency-on-sustainable-business">SSI as a Driver of Transparency on Sustainable Business</h2>
  <p>To enable apps to use SSI for business-to-business communication, SAP Innovation Center Network has developed a multi-tenant service built on <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> (SAP BTP) called Decentralized Identity Management. With this service, customers can issue and manage verifiable credentials – and verify the credentials themselves – creating the foundation for a decentralized business network where multiple parties can collaborate and share data.</p>
  <p>Shakeri’s team is currently working on a use case for sharing ESG (environmental, social, and governance) certificates. “These certificates certify that a supplier operates sustainably, does not use child labor, does not exploit its suppliers, and so on,” he says.</p>
  <p>At present, it can be time-consuming to achieve transparency in the supply chain, particularly in terms of how well individual suppliers focus on sustainability in their businesses. With SSI technology, it will be possible to check whether suppliers operate sustainably by requesting their ESG certificates from their digital wallet before deciding whether to work with them.</p>
  <p>SSI could even make it possible to trace the origins of a product’s individual components across supply chain parties that work with different solutions – theoretically all the way back to the raw materials. While there is still work to be done to bring the full vision of SSI to life, customers can already benefit from the technology today in one of the many use cases that are likely to be significantly impacted by this technology. This can include supplier onboarding, master data management, and supply chain collaboration in the areas of sustainability and human rights.</p>
  <h2 id="questions-for-the-experts">Questions for the Experts</h2>
  <p><strong>Q: Will SSI be widely adopted?</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Shakeri:</strong> The outlook is very good at the moment, with many large companies actively investigating SSI and its potential. Government projects are also underway, including eIDAS (<strong>e</strong> lectronic <strong>ID</strong> entification, <strong>A</strong> uthentication, and trust <strong>S</strong> ervices) in Europe, which aims to provide European Union citizens with a digital ID based on SSI. One of SAP’s cooperation projects with the Dutch government is exploring the impact of SSI in the public sector. If a European digital ID were to be introduced, it would drive adoption enormously.</p>
  <p><strong>Is SSI a blockchain-based technology?</strong></p>
  <p>SSI is not inherently tied to blockchain technology. However, blockchain is often associated with SSI because it provides a decentralized and secure way to implement some of the key principles of SSI. Blockchain can be used to create decentralized identity systems where individuals have control over their identity information and can selectively share it with others without the need for a central authority.</p>
  <p>In the context of SSI, blockchain can be employed to record and verify identity-related transactions, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability. Some SSI implementations use blockchain or distributed ledger technology to anchor identity-related data, but SSI itself is a broader concept and not all SSI systems rely on blockchain.</p>
  <p><strong>Is SSI interoperable by design?</strong></p>
  <p>There needs to be a standard format for identity data that all industries and governments can agree on. SSI is still in the prototype phase, so we aren’t there yet. But given that it is in everyone’s interests, it’s realistic to assume that a standard format will be agreed on.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Innovation is not the first thing that springs to mind when you think of the concrete industry. But innovation and concrete go hand in hand at <a href="https://www.putzmeister.com/">Putzmeister</a>, a Germany-based global market leader of concrete pumps, machines, and vehicles that the construction industry requires to process and distribute concrete and mortar. For instance, in 2021 Putzmeister introduced the first emission-free, truck-mounted concrete pump, the iONTRON Hybrid, as a worldwide novelty.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Besides innovation, excellent customer service is a top priority for the company that employs more than 3,000 people and maintains a partner network in 90 countries.</p>
  <p>Due to constant business growth, existing customer service processes became insufficient and the company knew it needed to introduce a state-of-the-art solution that would support harmonizing field service management processes from a local and regional level to a global rollout.</p>
  <p>“We worked with SAP at various service locations in Germany, but service processes were heterogeneous and involved paperwork and manual feeds into the system. Although we captured a lot of data, the processes didn’t allow us to effectively leverage them and they often got stuck in PDF documents,” Bernhard Urban, head of Customer Service Germany at Putzmeister Concrete Pumps GmbH, said.</p>
  <p>As a consequence, Putzmeister set out the following goals:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Improve and streamline high-end customer service globally.</li>
    <li>Replace manual processes with modern, optimized, digitalized processes for field service management.</li>
    <li>Digitalize deployment planning of service technicians.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="introducing-a-global-standard-for-services-processes">Introducing a Global Standard for Services Processes</h2>
  <p>To stay ahead of competition, Putzmeister decided to introduce a global standard for its service processes and select an innovative and digital solution to support planners, dispatchers, and service technicians with the following main objectives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>More efficient resource scheduling</li>
    <li>Optimization of field technician assignments</li>
    <li>Harmonization, simplification, and digitalization of field service processes, including processing complex service reports with master data from SAP ERP</li>
    <li>Employee leveraging of inspection protocols</li>
    <li>Integration with mobile devices allowing field technicians to report time, material consumption, and expenses</li>
    <li>Sped up and digitalized shop-floor processes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The company found that <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/field-service-management.html">SAP Field Service Management</a> best suited its needs. The cloud-based solution helps digitalize field service and optimize operations while working to reduce environmental impact through efficient service delivery.</p>
  <p>For the implementation of SAP Field Service Management, Putzmeister turned to <a href="https://www.sybit.com/">Sybit</a>, an NTT Data company. “The Sybit team has comprehensive experience in the area and provided valuable recommendations and guidance, especially in early project stages,” Urban said. That enabled Putzmeister to go live with a pilot in less than eight months and involved business process re-engineering and optimization. The cooperation with Sybit was very fruitful thanks to an agile project management approach, intelligent key user training, and field tests.</p>

  </div>
  <h2 id="establishing-a-new-end-to-end-service-process">Establishing a New End-to-End Service Process</h2>
  <p>Service requests from customers are now entered into SAP ERP by the back-office team and automatically transferred into SAP Field Service Management for resource scheduling. Service technicians then receive a notification on their mobile device to confirm the order. At the same time, they get insight into inventory and can request the spare parts and materials they need.</p>
  <p>When it comes to order execution, technicians can have all the information at their fingertips, including various inspection checklists related to service categories and images. They can do material availability checks from inventory, confirm used and no longer used components, and request additional supplies. The service report is then created on their mobile device and submitted to the customer for confirmation. Moreover, the solution allows service technicians to include additional details to create the invoice, such as actual time recording, unplanned activities, automatically calculated daily allowances, and other costs related to the on-site service.</p>
  <p>The benefits Putzmeister achieved are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One harmonized, digitalized, and integrated service process for service locations in Germany and the global industrial technology team</li>
    <li>Optimized customer service thanks to instantly available information, such as machine data, operating hours, error quotes, and faster invoicing after order fulfillment</li>
    <li>A single source of truth for all information that helps increase service quality</li>
    <li>Transparent, digitally available, real-time service reports</li>
    <li>Increased productivity and time savings for planners, dispatchers, and technicians</li>
    <li>High user acceptance from service staff due to a modern user interface (UI), mobile access, and better insights to execute work orders</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="preparing-for-an-international-rollout">Preparing for an International Rollout</h2>
  <p>After the successful pilot implementation in Germany and first international rollout in Spain, Putzmeister wants to take the next step and roll out <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/field-service-management.html">SAP Field Service Management</a> to its global operations.<br><br>“The digitalization of field service management brings countless benefits, both for our customers and our employees, and helps us gain more efficiency,” Urban concluded.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Five years ago, event manager Jenny Bittmann was given a mission: to shrink the ecological footprint of <a href="/topics/events">SAP events</a> and to firmly integrate aspects like diversity, inclusion, and social issues into event planning and execution. To accomplish this, she and her colleagues in the Sustainability department and elsewhere developed a strategy and published guidelines.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I spoke with her about the success of the project and where there is still room for improvement.</p>
  <p><strong>Q: What are your greatest successes so far on your mission to make SAP events more sustainable?</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Bittmann:</strong> First of all, it’s a real success to have advanced this topic to the top of the agenda. When event managers from Google and Amazon approach us at the <a href="https://imex-frankfurt.com/der-herzschlag-der-globalen-business-events-community">IMEX</a>, one of the largest trade shows for business events, and ask us how we launched and implemented our strategy for sustainable events, it shows that we’re pioneers in this extremely important area.</p>

  <p>I’m also proud that we’ve started measuring our social and ecological footprint with actual figures, because that’s an important step towards real improvement. It lets us compare, readjust, and define even more ambitious targets. Our analysis of the last SAP Sapphire conference, which was organized as a decentralized event in the U.S., Spain, Brazil, and online, showed that we reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by nearly 24,000 tons compared to when we had just one central event in Orlando, Florida, due primarily to the shorter distances traveled. In mathematical terms, that corresponds to around 2,200 around-the-world flights!</p>
  <p>I’m also happy about a lot of little things, for instance, that we did without single-use plastics completely at SAP TechEd in 2019 in Barcelona, Spain, preventing three tons of waste – enough to fill a 10 by 10 meter room one meter high – at just this one event!</p>
  <p>To be successful, we all have to pull together. Our Global Events team, together with the teams in the regions, has proven that we have a huge amount of leverage together and are motivated to get even better.</p>
  <p><strong>What are the biggest challenges you face?</strong></p>
  <p>The global strategy and our specific action recommendations can’t always be implemented uniformly because they depend on each country’s economic and cultural context. In Brazil, for example, good hospitality means putting the best meats on the table – which made it a real headache for the local event team members to create a menu that was 40% vegetarian. They found a good compromise, however, by making sure to choose meat varieties that had a smaller ecological footprint than others.</p>
  <p>In some parts of Asia, in contrast, it would be considered rude if we didn’t give small gifts to speakers as a sign of gratitude. In this case, we and the event team considered potential alternatives to the usual giveaways, for instance tree-planting certificates as an unusual gift.</p>
  <p>These examples underscore how we often have to think outside the box together and identify new solutions, but can also unleash creativity in the process and sometimes even change people’s mindsets.</p>
  <p><strong>What are your targets for the coming year?</strong></p>
  <p>We want to improve our waste prevention even further and increase our recycling quota. We want to avoid non-reusable plastics completely and use sustainable materials for our branding items as much as possible. As far as emissions are concerned, we want to reduce travel activities even more, and we’ve been purchasing carbon offsets for unavoidable trips for some time now. When it comes to catering, we want to offer more vegetarian dishes and locally source at least half of the food served.</p>
  <p>In addition, we are striving to recruit more female speakers to the stage, gain more social enterprises as suppliers, and strengthen social partnerships. Even if it means extra work for the local teams, I’m very impressed that so many of my colleagues spare no effort to achieve measurable improvements – and I hope their numbers will continue to grow!</p>
  <p><strong>Do you have any advice for people who want to do their part in making company events more sustainable?</strong></p>
  <p>We should have the courage to do things differently – and better! One example: the most recent shareholders’ meeting was the first one to do away with SAP plastic bags, notepads, and pens, and the outcry was much less than expected. We simply decided to scrutinize this established practice because when both the integrated report and the ballot papers are exclusively virtual, shareholders don’t need these things anymore.</p>
  <p>There are many examples of things “that we’ve always done that way” – call them into question! When we banned disposable beverage bottles at SAP TechEd, no one shed a tear. The visitors were thrilled by our concept of giving out high-quality bottles and offering endless refills at the water stations. At the same time, this also supported a water project, which was very well received.</p>
  <h2 id="banners-to-bags">Banners to Bags</h2>
  <p>In 2023, the event team for Hannover Messe had a creative idea for giving a second life to the 260 m² of printed fabric banners at SAP’s booth. They brought some of it to <a href="https://lebenshilfe-bruchsal.de/">Lebenshilfe Bruchsal-Bretten e.V.</a>, a workshop for the disabled, where it was sewed into 260 shopping bags as part of the <a href="https://comebags.de/nachhaltig/">Comebags</a> project. The rest was turned into 200 cable bags by Heidelbag, a local company.</p>
  <p>The team has also made major strides in reducing electricity consumption; reusing promotional gifts, wood, and other materials; reducing food waste and travel activities; and in many other areas.</p>

  <h2 id="capgpt--create-business-apps-with-generative-ai">capGPT – Create Business Apps with Generative AI</h2>
  <p>A mixture of fright and thrill rippled through the tech community when AI chatbot ChatGPT entered the stage in December 2022, setting new standards for generative AI. In Walldorf, Germany, SAP software architect David Kunz immediately wondered whether ChatGPT’s large language model could be applied not only to answering questions about everything and anything, but also to writing code for apps.</p>
  <p>“To build SAP extensions running on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) – even if it’s just to build a prototype – requires a lot of deep knowledge, including learning programming languages,” Kunz explains. “Even for experienced developers, it can take up to a week to complete a prototype.”</p>
  <p>Still, his suggestion of having a large language model like ChatGPT generate apps was met with skepticism.</p>
  <p>“‘That’s too ambitious,’ was what everyone thought at the time,” Kunz remembers. “To be honest, this feedback was justified. I was not at all sure it was going to work. But I knew the general direction steps had to be taken in.”</p>

  <h2 id="breakthrough-on-a-friday-night">Breakthrough on a Friday night</h2>
  <p>The idea never left him. One Friday evening in spring 2023, Kunz sat down and started to work through the steps he had outlined in his proposal earlier.</p>
  <p>At half past midnight, he sent out a video of the successfully completed process to his colleagues. From there capGPT made its way – in a refined form able to generate not only backend applications, but also user interfaces – to CTO and Executive Board Member of SAP SE Juergen Mueller’s <a href="/2023/05/sap-sapphire-orlando-keynote-defining-future-through-innovation">SAP Sapphire keynote</a>.</p>
  <p>“The support I received was amazing,” says Kunz, who now divides his time between capGPT and his role as an architect with the CAP team. capGPT has been adopted by many SAP developers for their own generative AI projects.</p>
  <p>capGPT allows users to write down in natural language what their app prototype should be able to do, receive all the code – which previously had to be written by hand – in as little as 30 seconds, and access the prototype to test it. This not only saves experienced developers an amazing amount of time, but also enables non-developers to create prototypes of the apps they need.</p>
  <p>“From experienced developers spending a week to build a prototype to anyone spending 30 seconds – that’s what capGPT does,” Kunz says. “And by just looking at the code, it’s impossible to tell whether it was written by a human or by the machine.”</p>

  <h2 id="cap--the-sap-cloud-application-programming-model">CAP – The SAP Cloud Application Programming Model</h2>
  <p>When SAP Cloud Platform became available, there was a hot debate going in the SAP developer community on how to best build applications on top of it.</p>
  <p>Developers could choose from a huge number of technologies, but there was a general lack of guidance. Also, integration with the platform services required a relatively high effort.</p>
  <p>Ole Lilienthal, senior development manager for SAP Cloud Application Programming, says: “We realized that, regardless of the business problem their app was supposed to solve, each developer and every development team was facing similar efforts when integrating with all the existing cloud services the platform offered.”</p>
  <p>With the SAP Cloud Application Programming (CAP) Model, Lilienthal and his team hit the bull’s-eye.</p>
  <p>Started in 2018, the project was aiming for a programming model that could guide developers when building apps on SAP Cloud Platform, which has evolved into what is now SAP Business Technology Platform.</p>

  <h2 id="safeguarding-customers-investments-and-increasing-speed-and-productivity">Safeguarding Customers’ Investments and Increasing Speed and Productivity</h2>
  <p>“With CAP as a development framework, we wanted to automatically solve about 80% of the problems every backend developer is facing,” Lilienthal explains.</p>
  <p>Typically, those problems include multi-tenancy, expandability, or business features such as localization and translatability. But thanks to CAP’s domain-driven approach, it is no longer necessary to always change the coding in each of those cases. As for special use cases that CAP doesn’t cover, the coding can be easily added to build in this functionality.</p>
  <p>“This has been a huge improvement to the productivity and speed of developers and also to the alignments between development teams,” Lilienthal says.</p>
  <p>To help safeguard customers’ investments, CAP offers the possibility to interchange components, such as runtime or the database, without changing the actual implementation.</p>
  <p>As they saw the advantages CAP offers, internal SAP developers started to migrate from their existing stacks. External feedback has been particularly good, leading over time to the forming of a wide external community around CAP.</p>
  <p>The team – located mostly in Walldorf and Bangalore, India – took a couple of already existing innovations and created something new, and then brought it to the next level. In a world of rapidly changing cloud technologies, the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model can accelerate development and safeguard customers’ investments.</p>

  <p>Traditionally, procurement challenges involve minimizing costs, sustaining quality, and ensuring on-time delivery. But in an increasingly volatile world, procurement goals have evolved to be more complex, as they now involve running in a sustainable and socially responsible manner.</p>
  <p>“Category management is one of the leading practices that help procurement drive efficiencies,” says Lincy T. Elizabeth, product manager for SAP Ariba Category Management, SAP Labs Bangalore. “It allows organizations to categorize spend, focus on consolidation, and enhance efficiencies with a holistic view of all the requirements in terms of goods and services that are needed across multiple departments, regions, and geographical locations.”</p>
  <p>“However, what has always kept category management from reaching its full potential is that it is a manual and data-intensive exercise that results in isolated offline strategy documents disconnected from execution systems,” Elizabeth says. “It seldom translates to successful execution and strategy compliance.”</p>
  <p>This is where the SAP Ariba Category Management solution comes in: it can digitize this entire process.</p>

  <p>Data analysis is key in this process, so instead of having to drill down to find information, SAP Ariba Category Management can serve up data intelligently. It features a guided process leveraging analytics, generative AI, and modular tools – helping to make an otherwise complex, time-consuming process into a streamlined one.</p>
  <p>Customers have acknowledged the need for digitized category management and the value that this solution brings them.</p>
  <p>“This is very evident in the solution’s inclusion in renewal discussions and the subsequent wins,” Elizabeth says. “In fact, most customers we speak to see category management as one of the top drivers for digital transformation in their procurement organization.”</p>
  <p>SAP Ariba Category Management can empower procurement to be a catalyst in an organization’s journey towards becoming an agile, intelligent, and sustainable enterprise.</p>
  <p>“We saw the untapped opportunities in the manual process of category management and sprang into action,” Elizabeth explains. “Our team underscores SAP’s innovative spirit as we brought this innovation to our customers in just under two years. We’re immensely proud to see the value it can provide to customers in the longer run.”</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Here’s to 10 years of innovation work with customers and partners! After a week of events and activities, SAP AppHaus received a lot of feedback.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Since its inception in 2013, SAP AppHaus has been a hub for fostering a culture of human-centered innovation. With the help of design and architecture thinking, the global team aims to bring sustainable customer solutions into the hands of people. On November 28, 2023, SAP AppHaus opened its doors to customers, SAP AppHaus Network partners, analysts, guest speakers, and SAP colleagues to not only celebrate the past decade of successful customer co-innovation but also allow for a look into the future.</p>
  <h2 id="years-sap-apphaus-10-years-successful-customer-innovation">10 Years SAP AppHaus, 10 Years Successful Customer Innovation</h2>
  <p>The evening kicked off with a <a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/anniversary">video message</a> by Juergen Mueller, CTO and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. He congratulated the SAP AppHaus team on their ability to stay curious, flexible, and at the forefront of new technologies, all while maintaining a focus on SAP’s customers and partners.</p>
  <p>After a warm welcome, Anja Schneider, SVP T&#x26;I COO, handed over to Andreas Hauser, SVP and head of SAP AppHaus Network. In his keynote, he focused on the team’s ability to constantly adapt to a changing and evolving technology landscape. Through stories and anecdotes of customer projects, he showcased how the team initially started working on user experience (UX) improvements 10 years ago. He continued describing how it is now focusing on helping customers identify specific use cases for generative artificial intelligence (AI) built with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP)</a>, keeping the human in the center, and designing new methodologies that can empower teams to empathize with end users, identify their pain points, and co-create solutions that can truly address their users’ needs.</p>
  <p>Before closing his keynote, Hauser shared his personal moment of gratitude. A few weeks back, Tim Brown, chair of IDEO, who brought design thinking into the business world two decades ago, congratulated SAP AppHaus, saying “Congratulations to 10 years of SAP AppHaus! It is remarkable what you achieved. All your competitors tried it, but you succeeded.” This quote builds the bridge to when Professor Hasso Plattner, chairman of the Supervisory Board of SAP SE, introduced design thinking to SAP in 2004.</p>
  <h2 id="the-power-of-collaboration">The Power of Collaboration</h2>
  <p>To bring together diverse perspectives and expertise, SAP AppHaus invited customers, analysts, and partners to participate in a panel discussion. Their different views served as a catalyst for meaningful conversations and provided good advice and insights. Here’s what the panelists had to say.</p>

        <p>“When working with the SAP AppHaus team, we noticed that they came to help, not sell, in the first place. Until today, our most successful digital solution we have at Rolls-Royce Power Systems is the one we jointly developed with SAP AppHaus.”</p>
        <p>— Daniel Eberle, vice president of Digital IT<br>at Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG</p>
        <p>“I think we must empower every employee to become an innovator. The mindset SAP AppHaus conveys and the tools provided are supporting this mission. Furthermore, we must encourage future thinking since it is the best way to create the desired future for all of us.”</p>
        <p>— Harriet Kasper, researcher at Fraunhofer IAO</p>
        <p>“Thanks to the collaboration with the SAP AppHaus team that facilitated a very helpful generative AI exploration workshop, Döhler was able to design and build a solution with SAP Business Technology Platform and generative AI that revolutionized how we manage our extensive product portfolio. What’s more, the new solution also streamlines the process both for our customers and sales teams. The generative AI workshop was a crucial turning point, expanding our understanding of challenges beyond just technology. This partnership has not only improved our efficiency but also opened new avenues for innovation and customer engagement.”</p>
        <p>— Pierre Wiese, member of the IT Leadership team and<br>head of Business Applications Commercial &#x26;<br>Group Management at Döhler Group</p>
        <p>“Human-centered innovation, as pioneered by SAP AppHaus, is what truly differentiates SAP to its customers. Everything must be designed, from our products and services to how we engage with the market. As technologists, we often focus on what technology can do. With human-centered innovation, the focus shifts to what humans can achieve with technology. It is the application of technology and not the technology of applications that is important.”</p>
        <p>— Paul Saunders, head of Product Strategy and chief evangelist<br>of Cloud ERP for SAP, former lead analyst for SAP at Gartner</p>
        <p>“As an SAP partner with a clear focus on the topics of user experience and SAP Business Technology Platform, we never completely fit into one of the established partner categories. With SAP AppHaus Network, this really changed. Finally, we found a home for our UX activities within the SAP ecosystem. Together as a network with more than 15,000 people, we have a lot more power to follow our mission: to convince customers of the great benefits of human-centered innovation.</p>
        <p>— Christian Heinrich, member of the Executive Board of sovanta AG,<br>SAP AppHaus Network partner, Marketing &#x26; Solutions,<br>Experience Management, and Design Labs</p>
        <p>“As dedicated member of the SAP AppHaus Network community, we at AGILITA take pride in the collaborative spirit that inspires us within this dynamic network. It’s a platform where ideas flow, methods elevate, and innovation is cultivated. Together we rise, fueled by the collective strength of shared insights and methodologies, bringing the transformative power of SAP’s cloud innovations with SAP BTP to our customers, crafting a future where ingenuity knows no bounds.”</p>
        <p>— Sandra Völler, CEO and founder of AGILITA AG,<br>SAP AppHaus Network partner, Switzerland</p>
        <h2 id="a-look-into-the-future-of-generative-ai-with-aleph-alpha">A Look into the Future of Generative AI with Aleph Alpha</h2>
        <p>A special guest one evening was Jonas Andrulis, CEO of the Heidelberg startup <a href="https://aleph-alpha.com/">Aleph Alpha</a>. He gave a talk on his view of the possibilities and constraints the current rise of generative AI brings.</p>
        <p>SAP AppHaus, as an incubation hub for new technologies and methodologies, has already developed a <a href="https://apphaus.sap.com/resource/generative-ai-explore-workshop">generative AI workshop</a> format that aims to explore and identify opportunities for specific business use cases together with customers.</p>
        <h2 id="work-hard-play-hard">Work Hard, Play Hard</h2>
        <p>SAP AppHaus has achieved remarkable milestones over the past decade, thanks to the unwavering dedication, hard work, and collaborative spirit of its team and network. To express gratitude and celebrate this success, SAP AppHaus invited current team members, alumni, and SAP AppHaus Network partners to an afterwork party on November 29. With Music@SAP setting the tone, the evening was filled with lively conversations, infectious laughter, and lots of dancing.</p>
        <p>The SAP AppHaus team showcased their combined creative power by transforming the workshop space of SAP AppHaus into a stage, a vibrant dance floor, and, on the third day, an interactive exhibition showcasing the different innovation methodologies. From designing the decorations to orchestrating the entire anniversary week, the whole team made all the different events come to life. Typical for the SAP AppHaus team, it was also a testament to the belief that those who work hard are allowed to have a great time!</p>
        <h2 id="the-only-constant-is-change">The Only Constant Is Change</h2>
        <p>In her closing remarks, panelist Harriet Kasper shared her observations: “Your customer focus was the only constant while everything else changed. […] Innovation initiatives need to evolve and adapt. They require more change than other parts of the organization. To me, SAP AppHaus represents a certain mindset. You can sense and observe this mindset, always adapting and transforming. This is a great example, especially coming from a company like SAP, which wouldn’t be the first to come to mind when you think of innovation.”</p>
        <p>Looking back on 10 years of innovation work and a week of celebrations, one thing is clear for the SAP AppHaus team: although external factors, such as the strategy or technological landscape, might have changed, the way SAP AppHaus works, placing the human in the center and making innovation real with SAP products and technologies, has never changed. It will certainly be exciting to see what the future holds.</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>A company’s established culture is usually a greater obstacle on the way to the cloud than technical issues. That’s why SAP supports its cloud customers with customer success partners that help make sure business objectives are achieved on the journey to the cloud.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The ability to innovate is a <a href="https://pub.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/innovative-milieus/ergebnisse-zugespitzt">key part of business success</a>. Yet companies also have to be able to transform market innovations into value for their customers if they want to stay ahead of the competition. It is hard to imagine attaining this kind of performance today without cloud computing. <a href="https://cloud.ionos.de/reports/idc-cloud-deutschland-2023">Analysts hold the cloud</a> to be one of the most effective tools of the digital age on the way to becoming an agile, highly innovative, competitive company. SAP has systematically embraced this technology since 2020 and is currently realigning its own organization to become a cloud provider. In my experience, it has become evident that the cloud is the only way to add value quickly at a manageable level of cost and effort.</p>
  <p>Cloud computing is disruptive, however, and demands enormous changes. SAP users, for example, also have to switch to the new architecture of the SAP portfolio, with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana.html">SAP S/4HANA</a> as the digital core, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP)</a> as the new environment for innovation and customer enhancements, and the <a href="https://www.signavio.com/">SAP Signavio</a> portfolio as the foundation for more efficient business processes.</p>
  <h2 id="overcome-mental-barriers-to-cloud-transformation-with-customer-success-partner">Overcome Mental Barriers to Cloud Transformation with Customer Success Partner</h2>
  <p>“The paradigm shift in IT to cloud computing has changed everything, especially the way I provide and deploy software at companies today,” explains Alexander Michnov, head of Strategic Sales, RISE with SAP, at SAP. To better support customers in this dynamic situation, SAP established the post-sales unit Customer Success Partner team in early 2022. Our role at SAP is to understand the business objectives our customers are pursuing in a cloud transformation context and helping to ensure they actually achieve them, above and beyond the technological implementation.</p>
  <p>According to SAP experts, the greatest obstacle to fully capturing the benefits of the cloud – such as faster time to market and simple use of resource-intensive high-tech – is an outdated process mindset. Therefore, a cloud transformation must focus on holistic changes to the corporate culture and business processes, not only on the technology.</p>
  <h2 id="smooth-transition-from-contract-signing-to-implementation">Smooth Transition from Contract Signing to Implementation</h2>
  <p>This change process is where the Customer Success Partner team comes in, assigning a customer success partner to every RISE with SAP customer as a complement to the SAP implementation partner. When an SAP customer starts a cloud migration project, they set off on a journey that can fundamentally change their organization – from their business processes to the way their employees collaborate with each other.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>First, the customer success partner works with the customer to determine the business objectives. This is followed by developing a road map that defines what needs to be done for the customer to achieve these objectives soundly. In the early phase of a transformation project, the customer success partner also helps ensure that the transition from contract signing to the actual implementation phase goes smoothly. This transition is the first critical element. The customer success partner helps make sure that all the aspects needed to add value early on – maintaining a clean core first and foremost, ensuring that training schedules have been developed, and confirming the customer has the right contact person if they change their mind on a specific process, for instance – are taken into account from day one.</p>
  <h2 id="looking-back-and-looking-forward-in-the-post-go-live-phase">Looking Back and Looking Forward in the Post-Go-Live Phase</h2>
  <p>The next critical phase begins when the technical implementation is complete. This is usually when tensions start to ease after the exciting go-live phase. But it is especially important at this stage to ensure users use the system in the intended manner, no communication gaps have arisen, and people do not lose focus. That’s also the perfect time to start the evaluation. Have the business objectives been achieved? Has the initial problem that triggered the implementation been solved? And, of course, this is a great time to discuss the next wave of innovation with the customer.</p>
  <h2 id="key-factors-of-a-customer-success-partner">Key Factors of a Customer Success Partner</h2>
  <p>Here are three key factors for a customer success partner’s work from the customer perspective:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Early involvement of the customer success partner, ideally during the sales process, to help define the expected added value of the project</li>
    <li>Organizational networking of the customer success partner in the organizations of the customer, the implementation partner, and SAP</li>
    <li>The customer success partner’s ability to harmonize the customer’s road map with SAP’s strategy – for the customer, it’s extraordinarily valuable to have a counterpart with whom they can discuss SAP’s strategic direction and planned innovations in day-to-day business</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As such, the customer success partner represents an ideal complement to the SAP implementation partner. The latter still bears overall responsibility for the system changeover during the entire transition process. In contrast, the customer success partner helps make sure that everything necessary is done so the implementation corresponds to the value targets defined in the beginning. They help ensure that all the aspects strategically important to the customer and SAP – starting with a clean core – are taken into account throughout the course of the project.</p>
  <h2 id="the-value-of-long-term-relationships">The Value of Long-Term Relationships</h2>
  <p>“The customer success partner is the guardian of the clean core and customer lifetime value,” summarizes Michnov, bringing a further dimension of the new post-sales organization into play. In the new cloud world, innovations and enhancements take place continuously and become available to customers extremely quickly, thanks to short release cycles.</p>
  <p>Cloud migration is like a journey from one milestone to the next. In this world, the commitment never really ends; it’s a world of long-term relationships. As such, my team’s mission is to support customers from day one and in perpetuity. The customer success partner enters a lifelong commitment with the customer. The customer success partner is there before the implementation, they are there after the implementation, and they are there even when no implementation is needed at all.</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>As a consumer you may not have heard of <a href="https://zamoracompany.com/conscious-company/">Zamora Company</a>, but it will surely ring a bell when you hear the names of some of its most popular premium spirit and wine brands, such as Licor 43, Martin Miller’s Gin, Yellow Rose, Ramón Bilbao, Champagne Pommery, and many others.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The international enterprise with headquarters in Spain and operations in more than 80 countries has been including environmental protection and economic growth into its DNA and is constantly working on achieving a sustainable business model that will be its future legacy to society and to the planet. Its commitment to the planet is based on four pillars: climate action, biodiversity protection, circularity, and conscious suppliers.</p>
  <p>The mission of Zamora Company toward its suppliers is to encourage them to be more sustainable by collaborating closely to substitute product and packaging materials with more sustainable alternatives and to use more recyclable packaging materials to support circular economy principles. It’s no wonder that, for Zamora, <a href="/topics/sustainability">sustainability</a> goes hand in hand with innovation without compromising the highest quality standards. <a href="https://zamoracompany.com/conscious-company/">Zamora Company’s strategy</a> as a conscious company is also focused and aligned with the achievement of the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a> set by the United Nations 2030 agenda.</p>
  <h2 id="accelerating-innovation-through-new-packaging-legislation">Accelerating Innovation Through New Packaging Legislation</h2>
  <p>Since the introduction of a <a href="https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/en_gb/impuestos-especiales-medioambientales/impuesto-especial-sobre-envases-plastico-reutilizables.html">new packaging tax</a> in Spain on January 1, 2023 on non-reusable plastic packaging, companies are required to meet comprehensive reporting requirements.</p>
  <p>The tax is an indirect excise tax with an environmental purpose. It aims to internalize the environmental costs related to the manufacturing and consumption of plastic packaging in the price of final products.</p>
  <p>The taxable event is the manufacturing, import, or intra-community acquisition of non-reusable plastic packaging for its use within the Spanish market. The plastic packaging tax captures a broad concept of “non-reusable plastic packaging” in its scope, which includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Non-reusable plastic containers – the law provides definitions of “non-reusable,” “plastic,” and “container” for the purpose of this tax</li>
    <li>Semi-finished plastic products, such as preforms and thermoplastic sheets, intended for production of non-reusable plastic containers</li>
    <li>Plastic products aimed to facilitate the closing, trading, or presentation of non-reusable containers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>“The new legislation required us to respond to governmental requisitions and was an additional driver to accelerate our sustainability efforts,” Enrique Gonzalo Mecández, SAP manager in Operations at Zamora Company, explained. “With a cross-departmental team, we were looking to find the most appropriate and scalable software solution to meet the country’s regulatory requirements and help us with data management, a tax monitor, and reporting and insights.”</p>
  <h2 id="keeping-all-data-in-one-central-place">Keeping All Data in One Central Place</h2>
  <p>As a result, Zamora Company found that <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/responsible-design-and-production.html">SAP Responsible Design and Production</a>, an industry cloud-based solution, would best meet its needs. SAP Responsible Design and Production can support manufacturers and retailers in calculating extended producer responsibility (EPR) obligations and fees, plastic taxes, and corporate commitments to optimize material choices. In addition, it helps improve design decisions based on costs and planetary impact.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“From a process standpoint, SAP Responsible Design and Production facilitates the incorporation of everything related to sustainability data linked to the material, so that all relevant information is unified in the material master,” Gonzalo Mecández said. “As all information is kept in one place, purchasing work and master data maintenance required to ensure regulatory compliance is centralized, without the need to manually replicate information in different systems.”</p>
  <p>“Moreover, leveraging a single and integrated platform with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana.html">SAP S/4HANA</a> provides the security of working with up-to-date and correct data. Additionally, the data quality application allows our users to detect any lack of information and correct it,” he added. “With deep knowledge and solution experience, our trusted partner <a href="https://www.indracompany.com/en/minsait">Minsait</a>, an <a href="https://www.indracompany.com/en/">Indra</a> company, closely supported us during the implementation of SAP Responsible Design and Production, as well as the integration with our SAP S/4HANA platform.”</p>
  <p>The benefits Zamora Company achieved include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ability to rely on 100% correct data, fully aligned with material registration processes</li>
    <li>Cost savings thanks to less administrative work, eased reporting, and a central data repository</li>
    <li>Reduced risk of non-compliance with extended producer responsibility regulations in Spain</li>
    <li>A simple, user-friendly tool to support legal reporting requirements in a timely manner</li>
    <li>Ability to expand solution usage to meet upcoming EPR legislation in other countries, like Italy</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="positive-impact-on-customers-economy-society-and-environment">Positive Impact on Customers, Economy, Society, and Environment</h2>
  <p>“The project helped us learn more about our products and incorporate their packaging details, so that our company knows exactly how much plastic and non-recycled plastic is being used. In a more strategic phase, this will allow us to evaluate alternative materials and compositions, which can create cost savings for the company and positively contribute to the environment by being able to transition to more sustainable elements,” Gonzalo Mecández concluded.</p>

    <div>
      <div>For thousands of years humans have tried to predict, manage, and control the future. Our ancestors looked for advice from oracles and read the stars. In more recent history, we have turned to science to determine future trends. But a fixed and knowable future doesn’t exist.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>As I look back on 2023, I recognize – with immense gratitude – that I had the privilege of experiencing one of those rare moments in the history of technology when a technology emerges with the potential to completely reshape the future. Typically, the end of the year is a time to reflect and look back, but personally I prefer to look forward and consider how we will adapt to the multitude of possibilities an AI future will bring.</p>

  <p>Generative AI is disrupting every industry, just like the internet did back in the 1990s. Both disruptions have something in common: people are at the center. The internet took off because it was easy for non-technical users to adopt it. This is exactly what’s happening now with AI.</p>
  <p>This signals the need for a skills shift. The World Economic Forum predicts that <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/reskilling-revolution-jobs-future-skills/">more than 40% of skills and 1 billion jobs</a> will change due to new technologies by the end of the decade. Up-skilling and re-skilling are therefore crucial. We can’t know exactly what the future holds, but we can equip people to adapt and thrive in a changing environment.</p>
  <p>In today’s world, it’s not about job security but skills security: recognizing that job security is a by-product of skills security. By acquiring and adapting skills, individuals can position themselves even in the face of automation. Like a bird landing on a branch, it’s not afraid that the branch will break, because it knows it can fly.</p>
  <p>Organizations must also understand their skills gaps so they can anticipate and quickly react to changes. At SAP, we’ve established a globally aligned skills taxonomy and we have prioritized baseline skills for development organizations such as AI, DevOps, and security. These are the most sought-after skills in our industry, and we are making training available to upskill in each of these areas.</p>
  <p>Increased skills transparency across SAP enables us to spot emerging trends, identify where we may have gaps, and prioritize learning investment. We used this process last year to ramp up our investment in AI learning even before the launch of ChatGPT accelerated this need.</p>
  <p>But technical skills are only part of the equation. There’s a common misconception that we all need to develop highly technical or scientific skills to succeed, but I also see a growing need for people who are highly skilled in interacting with other people! That requires a resilient mindset, critical thinking, curiosity, adaptability, flexibility, not to mention creativity, collaboration, and interpersonal skills. Those are core human abilities that are more relevant than ever in the age of AI.</p>
  <p>We need to start enabling children at an early age. This doesn’t mean teaching them how to use a device; they easily master that! But rather it is enabling them to unlock the potential of technology – while using data safely.</p>
  <p>Watching my own children, I see how quickly and naturally they are able to navigate digital devices. But interacting with the data is not something that comes naturally. That must be taught. We need to teach children to interact with data discerningly to set the foundation for a future where they can use technology not just competently, but also responsibly, making informed decisions in a data-driven world. Instead of discouraging their exposure to technology, we should guide children toward a deeper understanding of how they can use it to create, learn, and explore. The goal is not just digital literacy but digital fluency – a profound understanding of technology that goes beyond the surface. Enabling children to be creators, rather than just consumers.</p>
  <p>But we should not even stop there. I am a fan of <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/09/3-of-jack-ma-s-best-pieces-of-advice/">Jack Ma’s advice</a>: “We cannot teach our kids to compete with machines that will be smarter. We must teach our kids something unique, so that a machine can never catch up with us: values, believing, independent thinking, teamwork, care for others – the soft skills, sports, music, painting, arts, to make sure humans are different from machines.”</p>
  <p>I believe a human-AI partnership provides the best of both worlds, creating more value than either can alone. It’s a duet and not a duel. So, companies need to invest in talent as much as technology. And parents, as well as educators, have a crucial role to play in guiding their children toward an AI future.</p>
  <p>Next year will be about taking all people along on the AI transformation journey. Here’s to 2024: an uncertain but exciting future!</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Even when facing evolving business demands, many companies still succeed, accelerating their growth and disrupting their competition. A key asset is the adoption of scalable technologies such as generative AI.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="promo blue">

        <h3 id="drive-innovation-with-premium-engagements">Drive innovation with premium engagements</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/services-support/premium-support.html">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But what really makes the difference is access to high-quality expertise and best practices that optimize the value of those technologies for sustainable business success. For more than 20 years, top SAP customers have acquired this advantage through a strategic long-term engagement with the <a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2023/03/1c5988d6-667e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">SAP MaxAttention</a> program.</p>
  <p>Kurt Bauer, who is globally responsible for SAP MaxAttention, is continuously in contact with many of these industry-leading companies from all over the globe. He recently spent an afternoon in the office reflecting on the challenges companies encounter and the transformations they are driving with the support of SAP MaxAttention.</p>
  <h3 id="q-over-the-past-12-months-you-have-met-more-than-100-customers-what-are-your-observations">Q: Over the past 12 months, you have met more than 100 customers. What are your observations?</h3>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> This experience has been an intense time of exceptionally valuable insights into the challenges and driving forces that companies face worldwide.</p>
  <p>Business transformation journeys are influenced by numerous factors, such as target operating models, organic or inorganic growth, and consolidation of legacy structures, including business process redesign and custom-code management. In addition, our customers’ efficiency and agility targets are leveraging the potential of the cloud to help ensure resilient supply chain operations.</p>
  <p>On top of that, companies face a range of economic and geopolitical shifts, new data privacy regulations and cybersecurity needs, generational workforce demands, and sustainability priorities.</p>
  <p>CIOs have a lot on their plate, all of which requires more long-term planning and expertise.</p>
  <p>Our customers are navigating this world of complexity by transforming and modernizing their digital landscapes with technical advancements such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud. Some use the RISE with SAP or GROW with SAP offerings to benefit immediately from innovation deployments, and various integrated cloud solutions from SAP to amplify the value of end-to-end processes. Nevertheless, they’re focused on overcoming a staggering number of challenges to drive future growth, enhance business agility, and improve sustainability performance.</p>
  <h3 id="but-this-is-easier-said-than-done-how-do-they-manage-it-successfully">But this is easier said than done. How do they manage it successfully?</h3>
  <p>Such journeys can only be successful by realizing them step-by-step along a master plan based on end-to-end enterprise application architecture. The plan must be maintained and remain flexible to adapt to evolving business priorities and technologies.</p>
  <p>We provide a North Star service based on enterprise architecture capabilities, methodologies, tools, and best practices jointly developed and maintained with the SAP Product Engineering organization. For our top customers, the service helps ensure continued success with SAP, maximizing the value of their SAP solution investments with a long-range view into their future needs and opportunities.</p>
  <p>Achieving such a North Star architecture is a prerequisite to developing and realizing the master plan. No company can accomplish everything all at once. Many constraints and risks must be considered, yet nothing is written in stone because conditions can change. Together with our customers, we develop and maintain their adoption road map. And as mentioned, we need to keep the enterprise architecture current to reflect strategic and technological moves.</p>
  <h3 id="as-customer-specific-demands-remain-the-focus-does-standardization-help-organizations-accelerate-technology-adoption-while-minimizing-risks">As customer-specific demands remain the focus, does standardization help organizations accelerate technology adoption while minimizing risks?</h3>
  <p>Absolutely, and all customers I spoke to strive for it: achieving clean core process standardization and leveraging the power of cloud solutions. Many customers have enhanced their ERP-centric business functionalities, especially when building their continuously evolving digital landscapes on legacy ERP, such as SAP R/3 or early versions of SAP ERP Central Component. It was a common approach to develop everything perceived as needed.</p>
  <p>The fundamental DNA of SAP has always been to standardize, innovate, and scale business process capabilities by leveraging the full potential of the latest technologies. Meanwhile, standardization and completeness have climaxed. This has led to public cloud solutions with frequent and more consumable innovation deployments, allowing companies to approach the next level of interconnected company business networks and supply chains — intelligent enterprises.</p>
  <h3 id="how-do-these-companies-attain-standardization">How do these companies attain standardization?</h3>
  <p>It’s not easy, but well worth the effort. Business AI is a notable example of how these new capabilities will be made available continuously to the business for instant adoption.</p>
  <p>Most companies have started changing their mindset. They’re moving from an indisputable need for building individual functional enhancements and toward reengineering their processes to fit to standard and complemented by the extensibility capabilities of SAP Business Technology Platform. Understanding the benefits of rapid innovation adoption in the cloud requires a massive shift in change management and support practices.</p>
  <h3 id="sap-maxattention-supports-sap-solutions-across-deployment-options-and-their-integration-with-other-sap-and-third-party-systems-how-is-this-broad-bandwidth-supported"><a href="/topics/sap-maxattention">SAP MaxAttention</a> supports SAP solutions across deployment options and their integration with other SAP and third-party systems. How is this broad bandwidth supported?</h3>
  <p>Throughout every engagement, a technical quality manager (TQM) serves as an embedded on-site expert with a chair at the CIO’s table, learning, understanding, and analyzing business and IT challenges. TQMs maintain the service plan, pulling in the right engineered services from a portfolio of 160 services delivered by our center of expertise and, when needed, backed up by SAP Product Engineering.</p>
  <p>Essentially, TQMs are like family doctors: They take care of each customer’s long-term well-being and connect them to additional specialist consultations and treatments when needed. Our 160 engineered services cover everything from architecture and fit-to-standard process design to safeguarding the realization and enabling hybrid operations for end-to-end processes.</p>
  <p>Our tools, methodologies, and on-the-job training encourage customers to build up foundational expertise, making them more self-sufficient. But that doesn’t mean that we let our customers walk alone.</p>
  <p>As the strategic service engagement, SAP MaxAttention is teaming up with SAP partners to augment their value with best practices gained from engagements with industry-leading companies and close collaboration with SAP Product Engineering.</p>
  <h3 id="are-premium-engagements-such-as-sap-maxattention-available-to-smaller-businesses">Are premium engagements such as SAP MaxAttention available to smaller businesses?</h3>
  <p>Businesses, regardless of their size, face complex business challenges that translate into complex IT requirements. For that reason, premium engagements from SAP offer different engagement levels.</p>
  <p>SAP MaxAttention is a strategic, multi-year engagement that includes one or many full-time TQMs, an intense service volume. We have scaled our premium engagement experience to meet the needs and expectations of smaller businesses through the SAP ActiveAttention program, which provides part-time TQMs and requires lower service volumes.</p>
  <p>Both long-term engagement offerings offer access to the same services on demand with the agility to adjust based on customer priorities. Additionally, SAP MaxAttention has certain non-purchasable benefits that reflect the engagement’s strategic nature, such as the global SAP MaxAttention Summit with members of the SAP Executive Board, regional expert forums, virtual innovation workshops, or SAP Product Engineering sponsors.</p>
  <p>While front-running companies often leverage SAP MaxAttention, we also have customers that are not yet large enterprises but on a fast growth trajectory. They want to benefit from the expertise and best practices we gained from industry business leaders across the globe.</p>
  <p>Once they get acclimated to the experience, our customers often renew their engagement for many decades. They tell us they enjoy the value SAP MaxAttention brings, and we love supporting them with all our expertise. A recent <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/02/8c71d46b-617e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Forrester study</a> on the total economic impact of SAP MaxAttention confirms that the payoff is substantial and maximizes the value of SAP solution investments no matter the size of the company leveraging it.</p>
  <p>However, businesses sometimes require support for just a one-off, purpose-framed challenge. The SAP Value Assurance program addresses this need by providing a TQM and a more-prescriptive service plan to resolve the situation.</p>
  <p>Whatever the experience, getting started and heading down a path toward a long-term premium engagement can be an enjoyable experience. We have regular connecting points with our customers to exchange information about enhanced or new contractual models and the evolution of our services to stay relevant in changing times.</p>
  <p>A common principle for us is to productize our best practices to scale and share them with our customers, making them more self-sufficient and allowing us to focus on the next digital challenge.</p>
  <p>In an era marked by exponentially accelerating technology evolution, we do not rest. The SAP Cloud ALM solution, SAP Solution Manager, advisory and execution services for intelligent custom code management, and near-zero downtime services are just a few examples of how we productize our expertise.</p>
  <p>At SAP, we <a href="/topics/support">never let customers walk alone</a> as only our customers’ success is our success.</p>

  <p>At SAP, our commitment extends beyond traditional financial planning and analysis (FP&#x26;A), reaching across the entire enterprise of financial professionals. To achieve a comprehensive FP&#x26;A transformation, organizations need effortless access to crucial finance data, regardless of its location. In a landscape where financial information is dispersed across various applications, files, and systems – both on premise and in the cloud – organizations often expend significant resources on extracting, rebuilding, and integrating their financial data to deliver forecasts and simulations.</p>

SAP’s solutions for financial planning and analysis can provide a reliable foundation for finance information, delivering trustworthy, pertinent, and timely financial insights.

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Food security for the world’s growing vulnerable populations is driving <a href="/topics/agriculture">digital agriculture</a> across ecosystems united in providing access to affordable and healthy meals. Statistics reveal the incredible imbalance between supply and demand. While approximately 2.4 billion people worldwide are moderately to severely food insecure, the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/">UN</a> reported that a staggering 931 million tons of food is wasted each year.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The impacts of climate change and geopolitical conflicts coupled with volatile commodity prices and inflation are only exacerbating food supply chain challenges. Food prices are expected to rise 80% by 2050, and crop yields are forecast to decrease up to 30% by 2080. During a recent event at SAP’s Hudson Yards office in New York, agriculture experts and policymakers discussed how organizations in the private and public sector can work together to build a more sustainable food supply.</p>
  <p>“SAP continues to co-innovate with agribusiness leaders to digitalize the farm-to-consume value chain,” said Anja Strothkamper, global vice president of Agribusiness and Commodity Management at SAP. “Every organization in the ecosystem has the opportunity to come together and make a significant contribution towards affordable, efficient, and resilient farming, food production, and distribution. We collaborate across the food chain including agricultural production and farming, origination and trading, commodity processing, food manufacturing and packaging, and retail. These digital ecosystems help companies manage risk, improve decision-making, and maximize crop yields.”</p>
  <p><strong>Data Insights Reduce Complexity for Cost-Efficient Sustainable Farming</strong></p>
  <p>Case in point is the collaboration between SAP and VISTA that uses satellite images and AI-fueled algorithms to create digital twins that can simulate predictive forecasts for optimized decision-making in farming. VISTA is a subsidiary of BayWa, Germany’s largest digital agricultural company. I sat down with Strothkamper and Tobias Fausch, Baywa’s CIO, who shared how working together is cultivating the future of agriculture.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“Satellite imagery plus AI models capture and analyze a wide range of data in digital twins, including soil quality, crop variety and health, water availability, weather conditions, and other farming activities,” said Fausch. “The technology simulates yield predictions, calculating various scenarios based on precise risks by field location and weather patterns. Farmers can automate optimal soil preparation, irrigation and fertilization, crop rotation, and harvest times for sustainable efficiency and high yields. Even with the effects of climate change, these models reveal that we have sufficient resources to better manage global, end-to-end farming for adequate food production.”</p>
  <p>In one example, a soybean farmer in India used VISTA to harvest the highest yield ever, despite a drought in the country. Fausch said that optimizing crop yields sustainably bolsters food security and also makes economic sense.</p>
  <p>“Using the technology, we can automatically calculate the availability of water for not just individual farms, but also a region or country,” said Fausch. “This data can help governments better manage water resources for maximum crop yields in the face of events that make crop yields unpredictable. For example, if there’s a drought in one part of the country, water could be transported into dryer regions for storage and irrigation where it’s needed most.”</p>
  <p><strong>Digital Platform Scales Up Secure Food Supply Chains</strong></p>
  <p>Accessibility to advanced technology is crucial to organizations in the food value chain, especially smallholder farms. The collaboration between SAP and VISTA offers growers of all sizes a simple yet powerful tool to help capture intelligent data in the field using their mobile device. Available on <a href="https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-2001015636_live_v1/crop-planning-and-logistics-optimizer-by-vista">SAP Store</a>, VISTA is integrated with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/intelligent-agriculture.html">SAP Intelligent Agriculture</a>.</p>
  <p>“The digital twin is the smart superpower, and SAP makes the information available across the digitalized value chain, triggering business processes like automated irrigation and fertilizer services, increased storage and transportation capacities for higher yields, or accurate government subsidy payments for fertilizer,” said Strothkamper. “Public and private sectors can partner to extract value from the predictive modeling data. Farmers can increase yields, banks would have the traceability for investment decisions in startups to grow the economy, insurers can track claims, and governments can better plan and respond to dynamically changing community needs.”</p>
  <p><strong>Generative AI for Intelligent Agriculture</strong></p>
  <p>SAP’s agriculture solutions are evolving to incorporate the latest technologies like AI for valuable business results. An <a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2023/05/96a400eb-737e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">African-based sugar manufacturer</a> uses SAP Intelligent Agriculture to help smallholder farmers digitalize operations, providing advice based on captured data in the field and beyond. Farmers have already improved crop yields based on harvest time guidance.</p>
  <p>“We built this solution through our ongoing collaboration with organizations that are part of the SAP Advisory Council for Agribusiness,” said Strothkamper. “Climate change has rendered time-honored farming practices irrelevant. Generative AI can democratize intelligent agriculture with data-driven insights. Tools based on ChatGPT and other large language models that provide advice based on tremendous amounts of data throughout the ecosystem are the vision for the sustainable food value chain of the future.”</p>

        <p><strong><em>WALLDORF</em></strong></p>
        <hr>
        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced updates to its reporting and receivables financing practices, which will become effective January 1, 2024.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The updates mainly include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The inclusion of share-based compensation (SBC) expenses in non-IFRS results,</li>
    <li>The exclusion of gains/losses from equity investments, mainly driven by SAPPHIRE Ventures, from non-IFRS results,</li>
    <li>The general shift of gains/losses even on smaller divestitures to non-operating income/expense,</li>
    <li>The discontinuation of the company’s receivables financing program (“SAP triggered financing”).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The updates will be reflected for the first time in SAP’s Q1 2024 results, which will be reported on April 22, 2024. While the updates will not impact Q4/FY 2023 results, which will be reported January 24, they will be reflected in SAP’s outlook for 2024 as well as potential updates to its Financial Ambition 2025.</p>
  <p>“By implementing these updates, we hope to further increase the transparency of our operating results, while at the same time reducing short-term noise and volatility,“ said Dominik Asam, CFO and member of the Executive Board of SAP. “Including share-based compensation in our adjusted earnings may be interpreted as a disadvantage in comparison with some of our peers. But we believe recognizing share-based compensation as a genuine expense of running a business is long overdue. We are also convinced that appropriately reflecting it in steering and the incentivization of management will ultimately add economic value.”</p>
  <p>Reflecting the company’s increasing focus on cross- and upselling its broader cloud solution portfolio, SAP also announced its intent to replace the current “SAP S/4HANA Cloud” revenue and current cloud backlog disclosure with a more broadly defined “Cloud ERP Suite” revenue disclosure in 2024.</p>
  <p>Additional background on the announced updates, including a replay of an analyst and investor call hosted by Dominik Asam on Monday, December 18, can be found at SAP’s investor relations website at <a href="https://www.sap.com/investor">www.sap.com/investor</a>.</p>

However, the introduction of SAP’s new customer data hub has transformed this scenario, compressing the timeframe down to a brief 24-hour turnover. This accelerated pace can empower data scientists to efficiently handle multiple projects, significantly enhancing their productivity.</p>
  <p>To extract customer data previously, SAP’s data scientists had to go through a complex, time-consuming process involving a sequential series of tasks, sifting through vast volumes of entries, and coordinating with multiple departments to extract various data components securely and compliantly.</p>
  <p>To address this challenge, a cross-functional team spearheaded by Stefan Thomas resolved to revamp the process. The team was able to develop a prototype within six weeks using the Scaled Agile Framework and then collaborated with business and engineering teams to refine the hub. Four months of concerted effort culminated in the launch of the customer data hub in May 2023, marking its inaugural release to SAP cloud ERP.</p>

  <p>Within this tool, data scientists can kick-start data extraction requests by defining the necessary extraction through a brief description of their needs. The Customer Data Office validates the request and once it is approved, the hub can seamlessly retrieve data from the data pipeline and push it into the internal data lake, consolidating it into a coherent format. The customer data hub can not only facilitate managing data access requests but also helps ensure complete transparency throughout the entire process.</p>
  <p>Presently, the hub has processed 15 use cases and successfully extracted 550 customer data sets, marking a significant step forward in data extraction efficiency.</p>

  <p>Data integration is necessary for customers to gain intelligent, relevant, and contextual insights for better decision-making. However, without the right data management approach and technology, companies can face an uphill battle in integrating, processing, curating, governing, and augmenting their data.</p>
  <p>SAP takes a business data fabric approach, which goes beyond a traditional data fabric. A business data fabric is a data management architecture that delivers an integrated, semantically rich data layer over underlying data landscapes to provide users with scalable access to their data without duplication.</p>
  <p>It eliminates the need to recreate the business context that was lost from extracting and replicating data. This gives users the ability to accelerate their decision-making with trust and confidence, knowing they always have the complete picture of their data regardless of where it is stored or how it was designed.</p>
  <p>SAP Datasphere — and its open data ecosystem — is the foundation for a business data fabric. It equips any organization to deliver meaningful data to every data consumer — with business context and logic intact. SAP Datasphere helps customers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access authoritative data:</strong> Accelerate time-to-value by automatically reusing the semantical definitions and associations from SAP applications</li>
    <li><strong>Enrich all data projects:</strong> Harmonize heterogeneous data into a business semantic model of diverse data landscape</li>
    <li><strong>Simplify the data landscape:</strong> Access all data across hybrid and cloud environments no matter where it resides</li>
  </ul>
  <p>With a unified experience for data integration, data cataloging, semantic modeling, data warehousing, data federation, and data virtualization, SAP Datasphere enables data professionals to easily distribute authoritative business data — with business context and logic preserved — across the data landscape.</p>
  <p>Since the launch of SAP Datasphere, we have seen tremendous growth of customers innovating with this technology. For example, Messer CIO David Johnston describes his experience with the solution this way:“The business data fabric architecture enables us to bring SAP and non-SAP data together in the seamless and self-service way we’ve been envisioning. SAP Datasphere provided us with a solution to build a harmonized layer, or business data fabric, across SAP and non-SAP, cloud or on-premise data sources, making the best use of our existing investments in SAP, Microsoft Azure, Salesforce, and Oracle.”</p>
  <h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
  <p>For over 16 years, data integration tools from SAP have enabled our customers to turn disjoined data assets into actionable business insights at scale. Take the next step and begin your business data fabric journey today:</p>

  <p>SAP BTP brings together data and analytics, artificial intelligence, application development, automation and integration into one unified environment. Using SAP BTP to build its digital payments processing solution, PayPal now can offer a plug-in for SAP customers to manage payments easily online.</p>
  <p>Many companies in recent years have seen an increase in business and compliance requirements for sending and receiving payments across organizations. As a result, digital wallets, automated clearing houses (ACH) and credit cards are being used for corporate transactions. With the PayPal Braintree Digital Payments connector, SAP customers can use all these funding sources to reduce costs and complexity.</p>
  <p>The PayPal Braintree platform provides SAP customers with more payment choices. It is the only payment platform that supports PayPal, Venmo*, credit and debit cards and popular digital wallets in a single integration. SAP customers who purchased the SAP digital payments add-on can easily connect to PayPal with the plug-in, now available from the <a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/DIGITALPAYMENTS">SAP Help Portal site</a>. Customers will benefit from increased efficiency, cost savings, security and transparency, with the plug-in’s smooth integration with SAP software environments certified through the <a href="https://www.sap.com/partners/partner-program/certify-my-solution.html#software">SAP Integration and Certification Center</a>.</p>
  <p>“The payments space has undergone unprecedented disruption over the past couple years, driving companies to embrace more customer-centric, agile payments environments,” said David Bruce, VP, Channel Partnerships, PayPal. “That’s why PayPal teamed up with SAP to develop the PayPal Braintree digital payments app, providing consistent, standard access for SAP customers to connect with PayPal’s payment processing solutions. We hope this is the first of many adaptors built on SAP BTP.”</p>
  <p>Shane Gorman, Chief Operation Officer, Business Technology Platform, SAP, said: “It’s great to see technology companies like PayPal use SAP BTP to develop standard adaptors that our customers and partners can use during an implementation for a consistent customer experience and reduced complexity.”</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>SAP touches 87% of global commerce. This vast reach means our solutions organize much of the world’s supply chain, transportation, financial data, and more. It also means we have the potential to do so in ways that advance a low carbon, circular, and socially responsible economy.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Reflecting on the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (<a href="/topics/cop28">COP28</a>), the scale of SAP’s transformative potential – helping companies record, report, and act on net-zero targets and beyond – has never been clearer.</p>
  <p>I observed two key trends that will advance climate action in meaningful ways – a shift towards simplifying data sharing and a transition to sustainable energy – where SAP is poised to help.</p>
  <h2 id="a-shift-towards-simplifying-data-sharing">A Shift Towards Simplifying Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>In recent years, more and more companies have made net-zero commitments – often before knowing how to execute these lofty goals. At COP28, I saw business leaders wrestling with <em>how</em> to deliver on these commitments and publicly report on progress amid growing public pressure. They face two significant data challenges: the need for cooperation across the value chain and collaboration around a common language for data exchange.</p>
  <p>While many companies successfully measure their own emissions, reaching net zero requires an understanding of Scope 3 emissions, indirect emissions that occur in the value chain, where approximately <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/news-and-media/scope-3-data-strategies/">80%</a> of carbon emissions fall. This means that to get to net zero, businesses need to share emissions data across the value chain. This requires a high level of collaboration and information sharing among businesses and their suppliers. <a href="/2023/05/introducing-sap-sustainability-data-exchange">SAP Sustainability Data Exchange</a> can simplify this process by tracking actual Scope 3 carbon emissions data, not averages and estimates, and facilitating cross-company data sharing.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="move-from-averages-to-actuals-with-sap-sustainability-solutions">Move from averages to actuals with SAP Sustainability solutions</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/sustainability/climate-action.html">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>With solutions like SAP Sustainability Data Exchange, more companies can measure their carbon emissions data and share it across the value chain. However, this proves futile if companies cannot exchange data in a common format. They need to exchange information <em>and</em> understand what it means. Today, many emissions and accounting technology solutions fail to speak the same language with one another. To overcome this obstacle, SAP works closely with the <a href="https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Climate-and-Energy/Climate/SOS-1.5/News/Partnership-for-Carbon-Transparency-PACT-sets-foundations-for-standardized-emissions-data-exchange">Partnership for Carbon Transparency</a> (PACT), hosted by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), to create a harmonized data exchange system. Together, we are establishing the methodology and technical infrastructure for product-level greenhouse gas emissions data exchange and measurement so businesses can share real carbon footprints across the supply chain with increased interoperability.</p>
  <p>No entity can conquer the decarbonization challenge alone. But, with cooperation across the value chain around Scope 3 emissions and collaboration around standardized carbon emissions data, we can move close to net zero together.</p>
  <h2 id="a-transition-to-sustainable-energy">A Transition to Sustainable Energy</h2>
  <p>Given the focus on <em>how</em> to deliver on net-zero commitments and decarbonize operations, businesses look to energy as one crucial path to accelerate progress. Beyond aiming for net zero, geopolitical tensions underscore the urgency of bolstering energy security and diminishing reliance on overseas providers. As governments pursue energy independence and implement emissions regulations, corporations are compelled to adhere and transparently track their progress.</p>
  <p>As companies face growing pressure from all sides, the pace of the sustainable energy transition intensifies, realizing unanticipated benefits along the way. For example, firms experience enhanced reputations and boosts to market value. And, in the search for cost-effective and efficient energy mixes, many companies find improved operations. A surge in production efficiency often accompanies reduced emissions. These changes inspire more diverse business models, identify new revenue streams, attract new clients, and yield a broader customer base.</p>
  <p>As businesses move toward alternative energy sources, fostering transparency and trust through accurate data tracking and measurement proves challenging. Take green hydrogen as an example. Generated by the electrolysis of water using renewable sources like solar or wind energy, it offers a carbon-emission-free energy solution. However, fostering demand for green hydrogen requires a high level of transparency to ensure authenticity, build trust among consumers, businesses, and governments, and measure its environmental impact.</p>
  <p>SAP works closely with governments, the CEO Alliance for Europe, H2Global, and Hydrogen Europe to address the critical need for transparency across the entire lifecycle of green hydrogen – from production to distribution. Establishing a digital layer for green hydrogen guarantees its authenticity and differentiation from other grades of hydrogen aiding certification and proof of origin. This creates a clear market for green hydrogen, helping consumers understand its intrinsic value and positive environmental impact. <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/green-token.html">SAP Green Token</a> utilizes an energy-efficient blockchain method that helps provide this visibility into the hydrogen journey and can enable auditable volume movements among various partners.</p>
  <p>While digital technologies actively drive the transition to renewable energy, we recognize the indispensable role of collaborative, action-oriented partnerships in propelling these efforts forward. Ahead of COP28, SAP joined global efforts led by the <a href="https://globalrenewablesalliance.org/open-letter/">Global Renewables Alliance</a> to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030, accelerate the clean energy transition, and scale up investments in renewables. SAP also supports the <a href="https://www.wemeanbusinesscoalition.org/cop28-businesses-urge-governments-to-phase-out-fossil-fuels/">We Mean Business Coalition Fossil to Clean campaign</a>, a business initiative urging governments to phase out fossil fuels. The future requires collaboration with all stakeholders – value chain partners, NGOs, industry groups, and more.</p>
  <p>As the conference concludes, the real work begins. Reflecting on last week and the resounding call for global climate action, SAP remains committed to helping our customers simplify data sharing and transition to sustainable energy. The technology and the data exist. Now, we need to deploy these tools effectively and harness them to drive meaningful impact across a vast ecosystem of organizations. A sustainable future starts today, and the responsibility lies with each one of us doing our part.</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Disparity in education is not a new conversation in the U.S., but the pandemic highlighted and exacerbated the issue to a new level. Computer science was one of the hardest hit subjects.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>According to a report on the <a href="https://members.csteachers.org/documents/en-us/088b94ac-2ad4-4a9c-97f1-f7adc40d959a/1/">landscape of computer science education</a>, 24% of teachers in high-poverty schools reported suspending computer science instruction due to COVID-19, with only 14% of teachers in low-poverty schools doing the same.</p>
  <p>This, of course, is just one example of what happened to our educational system during the pandemic, but it is particularly problematic when we look at the importance of tech literacy in the workforce of tomorrow.</p>
  <p>SAP has continued to be a strong advocate for universal and equal access to computer science courses in every classroom by partnering with organizations like the <a href="https://csteachers.org/">Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA)</a>. CSTA’s work centers around building capacity in K-12 educators to provide relevant computer science curricula with the overarching goal to reduce barriers, support teachers, and advance computer science education across the U.S.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To learn more about the state of computer science education in today’s classrooms and where it is headed in the future, we sat down with CSTA Director of Education Shaina Glass.</p>
  <p>Glass’ relationship with computer science has evolved over her 19 years in education. While teaching at a STEAM magnet school, she became curious about the topic, which was simply referred to as “coding” back then. This started an impressive journey of making her way from a CSTA chapter member and leader to CSTA Equity Fellow to her leadership role today.</p>
  <p><strong>Q: How would you define the state of computer science education today?</strong></p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> In a word, evolving. Back when I became a CSTA member in 2019, it was hard to identify exactly what to teach or how computer science intersected with career education. These conditions have changed drastically. The U.S. is unique: we don’t look at education outcomes nationally, every state evaluates individually. If you want to see how states rank you can look at the <a href="https://advocacy.code.org/stateofcs">State of Computer Science Education Report</a> that is released every year.</p>
  <p>Another changing aspect of computer science education is diversity within the teacher pool. When I started 19 years ago, there were few teachers that looked like me. Despite some progress in diversifying computer science teachers, classrooms are still far more diverse than the teacher pool.</p>
  <p>Primarily, we are falling short in preparing teachers to feel confident teaching the subject. There are new policies going in place to make sure all students learn computer science, yet we don’t have anyone to teach it. We’re putting the cart before the horse.</p>
  <p><strong>Why is computer science such an important topic?</strong></p>
  <p>Everything we use in our life is a program. Nearly every job you can fathom today includes some layer of computing. Schools are focused on just needing one computer science teacher when, really, we need all teachers to understand and incorporate it across all content areas and curriculum. This is controversial, but it should touch our social studies and English classes as well as math and science.</p>
  <p>One area we struggle with in student standards is the impact of computing. The question is: How do we help the teachers who teach other areas see how computer science impacts their subject?</p>
  <p>We must make sure that students know that computer science is not one standalone class and there are no limitations on how they can use it. Students walk around every day with it in their pockets, which makes computer science one of the most vital areas for teaching today.</p>
  <p><strong>What are some of the barriers to getting computer science into the classroom?</strong></p>
  <p>The biggest component in my mind right now is teacher preparation — and not just preparing current teachers, but also preparing those who want to become teachers. We must be proactive and build skills for the outcomes we want to see later. In the world of computing, we are constantly investing in the potential of new ideas. Why aren’t we doing that with people?</p>
  <p>Preparing the teachers who prepare the next generation should be at the forefront of what we are doing for the future of computer science education.</p>
  <p><strong>As technology continues to evolve, what does the future of computer science education look like?</strong></p>
  <p>There is a place for artificial intelligence (AI), but more so for teachers to understand it from the creator lens versus the user lens. The story of computer science so far has been more about helping students to become the producer versus the consumer. We need to prioritize students’ ability to utilize this technology safely, ethically, and effectively.</p>
  <p>Right now, people are full of excitement about the power of AI, but we don’t have enough infrastructure built around how we should appropriately utilize AI in classrooms. Some are rushing to keep up with this demand for using AI, but we don’t have structures in place for protecting or educating students on how AI can impact them, or how it already is. Can we steer away from kids just using AI to them understanding what it is, how it impacts them, and how they want to see AI utilized?</p>
  <p>As part of the future of computer science education, we should be creating spaces where students can evaluate the field as much as use it. Let them be the creators and innovators of the next ideas — especially those whose voices have been historically missing in these conversations. Learning to listen and collaborate is critical in the field and can be done in any classroom, making every classroom a computer science classroom. Setting that foundation will change how education moves forward.</p>
  <h2 id="csedweek">CSEdWeek</h2>
  <p>One initiative helping move the needle of computer science education is <a href="https://www.csedweek.org/about">Computer Science Education Week</a> (CSEdWeek). This is a collaboration between CSTA and many partners. CSEdWeek aims to raise awareness of the critical role computer science has in the lives of our future generations. SAP continues to develop its impact in the space of Computer Science education with the goal of creating a more accessible and equitable future.</p>

      <div>Artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, continues to reinvent how we run our businesses and shape the ways people work.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>With Gartner finding more than 80% of enterprises using generative AI application programming interfaces (APIs) or models, and/or deploying generative AI-enabled applications in production environments by 2026, we know there is vast opportunity ahead of us to build the tools and layout the pathways to enable every developer to make an impact.</p>
  <p>We believe <a href="/topics/artificial-intelligence">AI</a> will have a profound effect on the way engineers and developers work in three fundamental ways.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, <strong>how</strong> we build our software and applications</li>
    <li>Second, <strong>what</strong> we build into the DevOps cycle tools and platform</li>
    <li>And finally, <strong>who</strong> can code using natural language conversations, extending programming beyond low coders to no coders</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Development will become even more democratized to anyone with great ideas and creativity.</p>

  <p>At SAP, we are at the forefront of business AI. SAP Business AI is about achieving real business results for the enterprise and making AI relevant, reliable, and responsible.</p>
  <p>We have embedded AI capabilities into our solutions including Joule, our new generative AI copilot, which understands your business.</p>
  <p>We are working relentlessly to bring these generative AI use cases to our customers, including educating SAP employees on best practices and providing AI tools internally to accelerate generative AI-embedded product development. We are doing the same for developers. Here are three specific ways SAP is empowering every developer to become an AI developer.</p>
  <h2 id="joule-natural-language-programming">Joule: Natural Language Programming</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant.html">Joule</a>, our generative AI copilot, revolutionizes the way users interact with SAP business systems and data. With Joule, users can easily navigate across SAP applications, find information, execute transactions, collaborate with colleagues, and receive proactive recommendations.</p>
  <p>Instead of conducting laborious manual searches, Joule users can reduce their average search and query time by up to 80% by asking natural language questions and receiving intelligent answers on the wealth of business data and insights available across the SAP portfolio.</p>
  <h2 id="sap-build-code">SAP Build Code</h2>
  <p>Our new application development solution, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/developer-tools.html">SAP Build Code</a>, draws on the power of Joule to create data models, application logic, and test scripts. SAP Build Code provides a simplified developer experience that drives productivity and supports fusion development by teams of professional and citizen developers.</p>
  <h2 id="ai-foundation-on-sap-business-technology-platform">AI Foundation on SAP Business Technology Platform</h2>
  <p>We believe that business AI capabilities need to be directly embedded into business applications and extensions. The <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/business-technology-platform.html">AI Foundation on SAP BTP</a> is a one-stop shop for developers to do exactly that, providing ready-to-use AI services and tools to accelerate the development of generative AI-infused applications, in a secure and trusted way.</p>
  <p>AI Foundation includes everything developers need to run their business-ready AI in the applications they have built on SAP BTP, from ready-to-use AI services to AI runtime and lifecycle management. We provide the tooling for the management of generative AI capabilities and ensure business data connectivity. We designed it with security, governance, and trust from the ground up.</p>
  <h2 id="looking-forward-the-right-model-for-the-right-business-need">Looking Forward: The Right Model for the Right Business Need</h2>
  <p>In early 2024, the AI Foundation will also include a generative AI hub, giving developers instant access to a broad range of large language models (LLMs) from different providers, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Falcon-40b. We will soon add more models.</p>
  <p>With this, developers can experiment by submitting a prompt to multiple LLMs to compare the generated outcomes and identify the best model for the task. They can then power mission-critical processes with complete control and transparency with features like built-in prompt history, all delivered with enterprise-grade security and data privacy.</p>
  <p>Our generative AI hub will also provide tooling for developers to supercharge their generative AI development processes and access to tools and techniques to extract the most relevant information from business and other data.</p>
  <p>To get the most value in traditional business areas such as finance, sales, or supply chain, some enterprise customers require foundation models designed specifically for business context. SAP is committed to fine-tuning generic LLMs on SAP anonymized data and, in the longer term, to creating proprietary foundation models based on our vast structured business data.</p>
  <p>These models will be able to address questions that users face every day in business that LLMs cannot, such as predicting invoice payment dates and supplier delivery quality or proposing efficiencies to a business process.</p>
  <p>At SAP, we are building the tools that will enable every developer to become a business AI developer, and in the process to become the true architects of the future.</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Everyone is talking about artificial intelligence (AI) now — and rightly so. Especially in the field of generative AI, artificial intelligence will leave no stone unturned. But another technology is making progress that, in my opinion, will massively revolutionize the business world, if not society. I’m talking about quantum computing.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Leveraging quantum mechanical effects such as superposition, entanglement, and interference, quantum computers could soon be able to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. The disruptive power of quantum already shows promise in fields of application spanning from material science and cryptography to business optimization and <a href="/topics/artificial-intelligence">AI</a>.</p>
  <p>A year ago, I tasked a team within SAP to study the unique features of quantum computers, with the goal to investigate how these features could solve complex business problems more quickly, accurately, and on a larger scale than ever before.</p>
  <p>At the recent <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum/summit/general-session-practitioners-forum">IBM Quantum Summit</a> in New York, we presented the integration of IBM Quantum services into our <a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ERP/fce9321b57d541ec9ffced02a4322571/f478b65334e6b54ce10000000a174cb4.html?locale=en-US&#x26;version=6.02.latest">vehicle space optimization component</a> as a proof of concept. This marks an important milestone in the progress of quantum computing towards practical, real-world standard business solutions.</p>
  <p>It is SAP’s mission as world-leading enterprise application provider to deliver the benefits of quantum computing via our solutions to our customers.</p>
  <p>While still a proof of concept, this engine’s connection to quantum systems demonstrates the potential for quantum computing to solve real-world business problems, such as packing a truck with assorted beverages, using a fundamentally new approach. Instead of simulating every possible packing combination, the quantum solver leverages the inherent parallelism of quantum to evaluate multiple possibilities, showing how to find a significantly superior solution than a classical computer.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In recognition of the rapidly evolving quantum computing ecosystem, SAP partnered with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum">IBM</a>, which offers a comprehensive suite of quantum hardware, software, and services accessible via the IBM Cloud and has an impressive multi-year technology road map.</p>
  <p>How did we approach this?</p>
  <p>Our exemplary standard component, vehicle space optimization, is directly leveraging quantum computing capabilities, fully automized within our application and technology environment. At the core of this innovation is the enhancement of SAP’s optimization engine through the incorporation of a potent quantum solver.</p>
  <p>Quantum optimization today is about tackling quadratic optimization problems. We augmented the optimization engine with the capabilities to map a business problem to such a quadratic formulation to then feed the quantum computer. This allows us to leverage different algorithms; for example, the well-known <a href="https://qiskit.org/documentation/stable/0.40/tutorials/algorithms/05_qaoa.html">QAOA</a>. The results coming back from the quantum computer, which are inherently probabilistic, are then post-processed within the optimization engine.</p>
  <p>Going one level deeper into the specifics, while high-level programming languages are common in classical computing, quantum computers today are programmed by formulating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate">quantum circuits at gate-level</a>. With our approach, we encapsulate the complex specific implementation of the quantum circuit within our engine, so that ultimately our ecosystem — customers, consultants, developers — will be able to leverage quantum computing for business problems without studying quantum physics.</p>
  <p>Despite the excitement surrounding these developments, SAP acknowledges that quantum computers in the current noisy intermediate scale quantum computing (NISQ) era are still too small and too noisy to deliver superior results directly. However, significant progress in the scale and quality of quantum computing in recent years prompted SAP’s collaboration with IBM to explore the current frontier of quantum computing.</p>
  <p>The integration of IBM Quantum systems into SAP’s cloud-native optimization service results in a platform to address the gaps that need to be bridged in the coming years. This significant step marks a crucial milestone in SAP’s journey toward the next generation of enterprise software for better business operations and value creation.</p>
  <p>As SAP continues to push the boundaries of what is possible, the industry watches with anticipation, ready for a future reshaped by quantum computing.</p>

  <p><strong>Sun:</strong> Like with other major technology shifts, such as the breakthrough of the Internet, consumer understanding and adoption pave the way for more rapid business adoption. I think the same thing is happening in generative AI. The rapid consumer awareness of artificial intelligence, especially generative AI, in the past year was largely due to the November 2022 Chat GPT consumer release opening the door for AI and business applications.</p>
  <p>Practically speaking, I’m seeing a crawl, walk, run approach to adoption. First of all, business leaders want to see it work. So, they’re going to try it out with close supervision and in smaller, more cautious ways to start.</p>
  <p>After they’ve gained some trust, they’ll deploy it more broadly. Later, they will be so comfortable that they’ll use it in all lines of their business. That will be a great opportunity for SAP to help these businesses crawl, then walk, then run through this process.</p>
  <p><strong>Where do you see the biggest opportunity for SAP in the AI space?</strong></p>
  <p>As a global leader in business applications, we can play a very big role in shaping how businesses adopt AI. It’s very exciting to be at the forefront of technology and also be in a position to do it responsibly.</p>
  <p>At SAP, we want to grow trust from our customers. As you know, SAP Business AI is relevant, reliable, and responsible. This position is deeply rooted in adhering to EU data protection laws. We have content filters, data provenance checks, and other features to help ensure accurate and reliable results. Our ethically responsible handling of AI helps ensure that customers can trust how we’re building these capabilities.</p>

  <p>I think we can use SAP’s unique selling point, which is our access to business data combined with this strong data privacy and protection standards, to get customers to understand that they can trust our technology. With <a href="/2023/09/joule-new-generative-ai-assistant">Joule</a>, SAP is already shipping generative AI capabilities and, as we saw at <a href="/2023/11/sap-teched-cto-juergen-mueller-generative-ai-development">SAP TechEd</a>, we have plans for delivering more both in product and for our developers in SAP Business Technology Platform.</p>
  <p><strong>How do we balance the urgency of innovation with the prudence of ethical consideration in the deployment of AI?</strong></p>
  <p>I think AI ethics is an extremely important part of our equation. Trust takes years to earn but can be lost in seconds with one failure or one mistake. At SAP, we have made investments in <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-ethics.html">AI ethics</a> to ensure we’re building responsible AI for our customers. This includes fairness, explainability and transparency, reliability, and safety. It also includes having accuracy of information, privacy, and security in place. We also have our SAP AI Global Ethics Steering Committee helping to ensure further safeguards.</p>
  <p>If we miss any aspect of this, we run a risk of breaking trust and moving backwards in our fast push to progress. From talking to customers, I’ve been reaffirmed that they want to know what’s going on under the hood.</p>
  <p>This is not just for knowing so they can share with their company leaders, but to help everyone be comfortable with generative AI because it is new to everybody. People are a little bit cautious as to what is possible, and they want to know what’s happening.</p>
  <p>The more we can explain, the more we show that we have the technology under control, the more comfort people will have in adopting and using it, which then creates that flywheel of more usage, more trust, and more adoption.</p>
  <p><strong>How do you view the collaboration between academia and industry?</strong></p>
  <p>With any new innovation, having the collaborative effort is really important to move fastest.</p>
  <p>As someone who has worked both in academia and industry, I see exciting opportunities in collaboration. At SAP, we want to build bridges, not silos. Let’s acknowledge academic priorities of publishing papers and state-of-the-art science and ask ourselves, “How can we partner so that it is a win-win situation for both of us?”</p>
  <p>We collaborate with academic research institutions to understand what state-of-the-art development is in the pipeline. Our role is to provide business knowledge and use cases and then merge that with the research scenarios to identify what could be practically implemented and be valuable to our customers.</p>
  <p>SAP’s relationships with many top institutions, such as Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, and Technische Universität München, are really great. Our membership into <a href="/2023/11/sap-joins-stanford-hai-corporate-affiliate-program">the Stanford HAI program</a> is a specific example. Beyond the research collaborations, the relationships help ensure that the best graduates from these universities think of SAP when looking for their first job and guarantee that we’re on top of the latest technology.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>An evolution involving many incremental changes has allowed SAP to enhance its sales performance management products, making them better, faster, and smarter.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Being at the forefront of innovation and with a steadfast commitment to enhancing existing solutions, SAP continuously strives to future-proof its solutions to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of business needs.</p>
  <p>When SAP announced the transition from CallidusCloud solutions to sales performance management solutions on the SAP HANA database, it was because these solutions have reached a significant maturity milestone and can meet even the most complex customer requirements.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="stay-one-step-ahead-of-changing-market-dynamics-with-sales-performance-management-solutions">Stay one step ahead of changing market dynamics with sales performance management solutions</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/sales-performance-management.html">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The move aimed to leverage the maturity of the solutions, providing more robust and adaptable systems capable of handling intricate customer demands effectively. As a column-oriented in-memory database, SAP HANA runs advanced analytics alongside high-speed transactions — in a single system, ensuring the applications run faster.</p>
  <p>Some of the largest CallidusCloud customers are now running <a href="/topics/sap-successfactors">SAP SuccessFactors solutions</a> on SAP HANA. In some cases, they are running hundreds of millions of line items at scale, with over 100 payees being credited individual line items. It is possible, as they get up to 10x compression, allowing for greater storage capacity.</p>
  <p>Being on SAP HANA offers the advantage of the open cloud platform, SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP), which brings together application development, data and analytics, integration, and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into one unified environment. With embedded analytics, multi-factor authentication, and many other capabilities, customers can have confidence that their incentive management solutions will continue to meet the global technology standards that are expected by their organization.</p>
  <p>With SAP BTP capabilities now embedded into sales performance management solutions, customers can run a technology stack that is enabling thousands of other organizations to solve complex business problems — from subscription billing to financial reconciliation and everything in between.</p>
  <p>SAP’s strategy is to launch sales performance management solutions on hyperscalers. This means customers have the elasticity they demand during peak runs, helping to ensure their system grows and keeps up with the needs of the organization. Available on Google Cloud Platform, solutions leverage Kubernetes (K8s)​ platform, moving from monolithic to microservices architecture to provide a more robust and scalable solution with market-leading performance and global reach. It simplifies operations, brings down costs, and deploys innovations faster.</p>
  <p>With this enhanced backend technology, the solutions gain superior speed, concurrency, scalability, and performance, helping to achieve lower downtime and higher availability. Enhanced application UI load time provides for an immediate improvement in user experience and efficiency of work.</p>
  <p>When it comes to SAP SuccessFactors Incentive Management, formerly CallidusCloud Commissions, the ways in which the solution has not changed is important. This is critical from the standpoint of risk reduction.</p>
  <p>While the solution now runs on the SAP HANA database, the data model remains consistent with its proven pedigree.* And while the sequels have been changed to perform better with a columnar database, the proven sequence of a calculation run remains the same.</p>
  <p>Similarly, the tooling has been changed to enable the validate and transfer steps to perform better using the express data loader, but the file formats remain the same. Embedded analytics provide a better analytics framework, but the capability to use external schema is now enhanced.</p>
  <p>In short, this is a now a world-class solution full of new capabilities, while still retaining the best of the original offering.</p>
  <p>SAP SuccessFactors Territory and Quota has seen more than 200 new developments since migrating to the SAP HANA database, and SAP SuccessFactors Agent Lifecycle Management, formerly CallidusCloud Producer Pro, also takes advantage of new capabilities on SAP HANA. These developments help ensure that the new sales performance management portfolio can meet and exceed demands of the most discerning customers at scale on one of the most secure platforms available in the industry.</p>
  <p>We are excited to share this information with CallidusCloud customers and look forward to helping your organization make the strategic move to the SAP SuccessFactors portfolio.</p>

  <h2 id="transforming-learning-in-the-sap-ecosystem">Transforming Learning in the SAP Ecosystem</h2>
  <p>Learning within the SAP ecosystem can be a daunting task. For both customers and SAP professionals, it can be hard to keep up with the landscape of ever-evolving innovations and advancing technologies. Constant learning has become somewhat of a standard with the transition to the cloud, which has resulted in a greater requirement for skilled talent. Yet the team behind the SAP Learning site noticed an unfortunate trend. “Most SAP professionals are not engaging in SAP Learning and certification activities,” says team leader Jan Meyer, global head of SAP Learning Systems. “Many customers feared a skills shortage impacting their move to SAP S/4HANA.” However, the SAP Learning team also determined that when customers and partners engaged in learning activities, there were tremendous positive effects in their technical skills and overall work satisfaction.</p>
  <p>The next steps were therefore clear for the team. As team member Marina Noble, head of Learning Systems Product and Solution Management, states, “These challenges and opportunities motivated us to significantly reduce learning, experiential, and commercial barriers and to create opportunities through learning and development for everyone.” Their realization led to the creation of <a href="https://learning.sap.com/">learning.sap.com</a>. In doing so, they garnered support from leaders across SAP, including Customer Success, Partner Ecosystem Success, Intelligent Enterprise Group, and SAP Learning. The goal was to tear down as many barriers to entry as possible by simplifying and consolidating information into one all-encompassing learning destination.</p>

  <p>Within the site, the team focused on simplifying discovery and access for all users. They eliminated the need for registration, simplified the complexity of the learning process by consolidating multiple learning destinations, and increased optimization for search engines and digital learning. They also made a wealth of learning content available for free. Timo Schuette, team member and global head of SAP Product Learning CoE, explains how, “Today, 191 learning journeys, many leading to SAP certification, are available in this new experience on SAP Learning in front of the paywall.” The results of this decision have already bore fruit, with 2023 showcasing a 250% year-over-year growth in users and a record 1.7 million active learners. On the other side of the paywall, the team created a premium learning experience that uses key methods to help maximize learning impact. Premium users can gain access to hands-on practice systems, expert-led sessions, role-based certification, and advanced learning analytics. Additionally, the premium learning experience has been substantially reduced in cost, allowing more partners and customers to reap the benefits.</p>

  </ul>
  <h2 id="a-new-and-improved-ai-customer-support-experience">A New and Improved AI Customer Support Experience</h2>
  <p>The team behind the new <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html?anchorId=section">“get support”</a> application on SAP for Me began with a blank slate. Instead of taking the solutions from SAP ONE Support Launchpad and applying them to a new application, they knew that the needs of customers using SAP for Me were different. For instance, the get support app would house the customer service requirements of many more employees using a multitude of SAP products. The case creation process would therefore have to properly support Digital Core &#x26; Platform and People &#x26; Operations, as well as SAP Signavio, SAP Fieldglass, and SAP Ariba solutions. Additionally, due to the influx in customer volume, it became a necessity to increase the customer self-service rate while making sure customers could still connect with the right experts to solve their issues.</p>
  <p>The team found their solution to these challenges in the implementation of AI. Built alongside the Artificial Intelligence Technologies team in the Customer Support &#x26; Innovation organization, they utilized the innovative technology to help reduce customer effort and improve the accuracy of responses. One of the key improvements AI has facilitated within the get support app is helping customers correctly qualify their problems through the channel recommender. As explained by John Bowley, team leader and product manager of Support Applications in SAP for Me, “Based on data analysis, an AI service derives the most suitable support channel to solve an issue, whether that is SAP Community or Expert Chat.”</p>

  <p>The team also used AI to help improve the self-service features of the app. While customers are providing information and getting support, an AI service will run alongside and present relevant knowledge articles to the customer. These articles will be based on customer input and will happen in parallel with the customer receiving support, helping to expedite the whole process.</p>
  <p>The new and improved get support app has already proven itself with positive outcomes. There is now a significant increase in the percentage of customers that start the case creation process within the app but don’t fully create a support case (64.5%, up from 32% in the previous application). This means that these customers began searching for help in the app and found a solution during the process without needing to create a case. Additionally, the app helps bolster the operational efficiency of the SAP support organization with its improvements in routing customers to the right support teams.</p>

  <p>The Value Advisory team collaborates with customers to help link their business strategies and experiences to their desired outcomes. But in the process of shifting to a cloud-first approach, the team faced a dilemma: it became apparent that their sales engagement strategy required modernization. An increase in the volume of deals within the cloud space required a faster, more efficient, and more consistent sales engagement approach that aligns with the specific needs of the customer. And pitching the cloud to customers came with its own unique crop of difficulties. “Justifying the value of cloud [to customers] is challenging due to the comprehensiveness of the solution spanning across the entire value chain of an enterprise,” says Nitin Singh, team leader and Value Advisory principal. The team knew that a data-driven sales perspective was the key to a more streamlined and dependable method for crafting compelling value propositions.</p>
  <p>To aid them in this endeavor, the team implemented the <a href="https://www.signavio.com/">SAP Signavio</a> portfolio of cloud-based business process management solutions within their practice to demonstrate value to customers through data-driven insights. As Singh explains, “This new approach involved merging business metrics from <a href="https://vlm.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/home">SAP Value Lifecycle Manager</a> with process performance data from SAP Signavio solutions. This integration allowed our customers to clearly see the connection between business outcomes and the process capabilities supported by data.”</p>

  <p>Previously, business cases relied on benchmarking a customer’s performance KPIs against competitors in specific functions, like finance and asset management, demonstrating problematic areas within the business. SAP Signavio solutions, on the other hand, rely on analyzing performance through metrics such as work order automation and backlogs, which in turn identify specific pain points. The team combined these two approaches – business centric and process centric – to create a system where data produced by SAP Signavio solutions was applied to business’ KPIs to help identify cases of suboptimal performance.</p>
  <p>So far, this new approach has impacted 170 customers. The approach offers a highly repeatable performance diagnostic that can be utilized across the SAP sales landscape. “It can be used to identify, clarify, verify, and amplify value throughout the customer value journey,” says Singh. With the merging of SAP Signavio and Value Advisory, the team even wound up creating a new category: process-driven value management. Customer feedback regarding the innovation has already proven to be incredibly positive.</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>In my role at SAP, I have seen firsthand the multifaceted challenges climate change brings, especially to youth. By 2050, we are looking at a world where over 1 billion people could be displaced due to environmental upheavals, with nearly 2 billion children facing increased health risks from intense heat.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>These are not just numbers: futures are at stake, particularly for young people whose education and opportunities are being disrupted right before our eyes. This stark reality drives home the need for inclusive and equitable strategies in our climate action plans.</p>
  <p>Youth are at the frontline of these environmental challenges. Their futures depend on how effectively we can address the impacts of climate change. It is a call to action for all of us across various sectors to unite and empower the voices of these young people, harnessing their potential to create innovative solutions.</p>
  <p>At SAP, we’ve embraced a four-pronged approach specifically designed to support and empower youth in their journey to a sustainable and just world: <strong>rally</strong>, <strong>represent</strong>, <strong>reskill</strong>, and <strong>resource</strong>.</p>
  <p>Sharing these insights at the <a href="https://rewiredsummit.org/">RewirEd Summit</a> during <a href="/topics/cop28">COP28</a>, where education is a focal point, reminds me of the critical need to intertwine education funding with our climate goals, addressing the immediate and future climate challenges.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>At the core of our mission for climate justice is <strong>rallying</strong> the energy and passion of the younger generation. I sincerely believe that climate action among young people is a key component of climate justice, and we need to promote that in various ways.</p>
  <p>That is why we support Green Rising, an initiative led by UNICEF and Generation Unlimited along with partners that supports children and youth-led grassroots climate action for a faster and fairer transition to a low-carbon economy. The aim is to directly engage 10 million youth, particularly girls, to take action by 2025 through volunteering, green skills, jobs, entrepreneurship, and advocacy. Our 2023 collaboration with Goodwall and Accenture has already launched digital challenges like #ClimateAction, #DigitalCleanUp, and #GoingZero with 15,000 active youth participants.</p>
  <p>However, I’m keenly aware that passion alone is not enough. The journey from raising awareness to finding real change requires more than just enthusiasm; it demands skill and knowledge. This realization bridges us to the next critical phase of our mission.</p>
  <p>Green Rising also recognizes the importance of equipping youth with the tools they need to make a lasting impact.</p>
  <p>The <strong>reskilling</strong> effort at the heart of Green Rising is about transforming energy and concern into potent, informed action. As we confront the reality of “eco-anxiety” affecting 57% of global youth, we understand that empowerment comes from giving these young minds the ability to turn their worries into wisdom and their fears into a force for good. By fostering climate literacy and developing green skills, we are not just creating activists; we’re nurturing future leaders, problem solvers, and innovators who will shape a sustainable world in areas like biodiversity, air quality, water conservation, and waste management.</p>
  <p>I’m fortunate to see how our dedication to reskilling is making a real impact. We are charting a clear course in initiating and nurturing programs that significantly boost young people’s employability and entrepreneurial capabilities.</p>
  <p>For instance, through accessible online resources like open.sap.com, learning.sap.com, and collaborations with our colleagues from SAP University Alliances, we are empowering individuals with the necessary insights to contribute positively to climate action. Efforts extend globally. With UNICEF’s Generation Unlimited, we have empowered more than 7.6 million young people in India, Turkey, and Vietnam with vital digital and life skills.</p>
  <p>Looking ahead, Youth Agency Marketplace (YOMA), co-created with young people from the continent, will reach 1 million youths in Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and the Philippines by 2025, offering opportunities for learning and reskilling. Additionally, the SAP Educate to Employ initiative is shaping future careers, training 100 young talents in each pilot country annually, with 25 stepping into internships or roles within the SAP ecosystem.</p>
  <p>These are steps toward nurturing a generation ready to lead the charge in sustainability and innovation.</p>
  <p>In my experience attending conferences, I have often noticed a missing crucial element: the direct input of the young people we’re talking about. It is one thing to teach and upskill them with the crucial knowledge, but it’s another to truly empower them to be part of the conversation. It is about going beyond just training and providing youth with real platforms to contribute their fresh skills and innovative ideas to the global climate conversation.</p>
  <p>This is what drives our approach to <strong>representation</strong>, with long-time partners and organizations such as We Are Family Foundation and ChangemakerXChange in programs like Youth To The Table.</p>
  <p>I truly believe that this is the real game-changer. Ultimately, it is something quite simple yet often overlooked: genuinely including young people in the conversations and decision-making that shape their future.</p>
  <p>This approach is encapsulated in the phrase “Nothing about us without us.” It’s about flipping the script, moving from merely discussing climate issues about young people to actively collaborating with them. They are not just on the sidelines, they are in the room where decisions are made.</p>
  <p>For instance, we are bringing 50 young leaders from across the globe to the COP28 conference to get their innovative opinions and learn from their solutions. We have done it in the past and will continue in the future at global forums like the World Economic Forum and the United Nations General Assembly. Watching young leaders confidently take the stage and influence global conversations is a powerful reminder of why we do what we do — it’s about empowering them to shape the world they will live in.</p>
  <p>A mere 0.76% of grants from major climate foundations currently support youth-led climate initiatives. This means while rallying, reskilling, and giving them a voice is crucial, it is not enough. To combat climate change, we must funnel more <strong>resources</strong> toward the projects and innovations led by youth, especially in the most affected communities. This means not just talking about, but investing in their ideas through project grants, mentorship programs like Climate Hacks, and corporate pro-bono consulting programs that connect experts with social and climate enterprises to amplify their impact and turn youthful enthusiasm and innovation into tangible, world-changing solutions.</p>
  <p>As I reflect, I’m reminded of the unique and impactful role corporations can play in driving long-term social change. Leading these efforts at SAP has been a responsibility and a privilege, offering a front-row seat to the transformative power of education.</p>
  <p>Seeing young people full of potential and eagerness to make a difference has been a constant reminder of why our work matters. Every digital challenge we launch, every skill we teach, and every voice we amplify is not just a tick on a corporate checklist. It’s about lighting up a path for these young leaders who will one day take the reins in creating a sustainable and just world.</p>
  <p>The conversations I have, the stories I hear, and the evident enthusiasm and determination among youth leave a lasting impression on me. They remind me that our commitment to empowering young people goes beyond the boardrooms and conferences. It is a reminder of the potential for corporations to contribute meaningfully to a sustainable, equitable, and bright future for all. It’s about nurturing a future we all share.</p>

  <p>For this occasion, I sat down with SAP Chief Sustainability Officer Daniel Schmid and Stephanie Raabe, human rights officer at SAP, to explore what role enterprises including SAP play, what’s new in the company’s recently updated human rights commitment statement, and what trends and challenges both see for human rights in business.</p>
  <h3 id="q-daniel-what-do-human-rights-mean-to-you-and-why-is-it-important-for-businesses-to-respect-human-rights">Q: Daniel, what do human rights mean to you? And why is it important for businesses to respect human rights?</h3>
  <p><strong>Daniel Schmid (DS):</strong> Human rights are basic rights for all people to live a life in dignity and be treated equally. For me it’s about ensuring a good life for all within the planetary boundaries. And businesses have a key role to play in this. While they can be a force for good around the world, they can also harm people and the planet; for example, through discrimination, unsafe working conditions, or industrial pollution and accidents with implications on human health. That is why the United Nations Guiding Principles (UN GPs) for Business and Human Rights not only set out the responsibility of states to protect human rights, but also the responsibility of business to respect human rights.</p>
  <h3 id="q-how-does-this-look-in-practice-how-do-companies-in-general-and-sap-specifically-live-up-to-their-responsibility-to-respect-human-rights">Q: How does this look in practice? How do companies in general and SAP specifically live up to their responsibility to respect human rights?</h3>
  <p><strong>Stephanie Raabe (SR):</strong> Globally recognized frameworks such as the UN GPs or the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct provide clear guidance for companies. They describe how to establish ongoing human right due diligence processes to “know and show” where a company’s actual and potential negative impacts on people are and what actions are taken to prevent or mitigate these. This also entails tracking the effectiveness of actions taken over time, and communicating about efforts and results — internally and externally.</p>
  <p>More than two years ago, we launched an interdisciplinary human rights due diligence project at SAP to take our existing human rights commitment statement, governance, processes, and disclosure to the next level and prepare for compliance with rising legal requirements such as the modern slavery acts in UK, Australia, or Canada, the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG), and the upcoming EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. We identified gaps in our policies and procedures, which we have been working to close.</p>
  <h3 id="q-what-kind-of-gaps-could-you-share-one-or-two-examples">Q: What kind of gaps? Could you share one or two examples?</h3>
  <p><strong>SR:</strong> One example is our grievance mechanism. We collaborated across teams to expand the existing “<a href="https://app.convercent.com/en-us/LandingPage/c11fcf9e-a052-ea11-a972-000d3ab9f062?_=1616097379987">Speak Out at SAP</a>” tool to cover human rights and environment-related complaints from anyone, be it internal or external. We defined clear rules of procedure of how incoming complaints are processed and followed up on in a confidential and, if desired, anonymous way.</p>
  <p><strong>DS:</strong> Another example coming to my mind is related to living wages. As a founding member of the Value Balancing Alliance (VBA), we applied the living wage methodology co-developed within the VBA. This helped us find few employees in SAP Brazil in 2022 whose compensation had to be adjusted to meet our ambition of ensuring a decent living wage for our own workforce as measured through the VBA methodology. We are now working toward regular reassessments to avoid future deviations.</p>
  <p><strong>SR:</strong> I would like to add a third example related to our supply chain. As we proceed with integrating human rights due diligence into our supplier code of conduct and procurement processes, we increasingly notice how important it is to get not just colleagues from SAP’s procurement organization onboard, but also all other employees involved with supplier selection. All of us need to consider human rights and environmental criteria in our buying decisions. The earlier this happens, the better. The point at which contract negotiations with suppliers start may be too late.</p>
  <h3 id="q-coinciding-with-human-rights-day-2023-sap-just-recently-updated-and-expanded-its-global-human-rights-commitment-statement-whats-the-reasoning-and-whats-new">Q: Coinciding with Human Rights Day 2023, SAP just recently updated and expanded its Global Human Rights Commitment Statement. What’s the reasoning and what’s new?</h3>
  <p><strong>DS:</strong> When looking back at our sustainability journey that started in 2009, I remember human rights being embedded in SAP’s holistic understanding of sustainability from the beginning. It has been part of our objective to create positive economic, social, and environmental impact all along. We therefore also established our first Global Human Rights Commitment Statement in 2011.</p>
  <p><strong>SR:</strong> That’s right. SAP’s commitment to respect human rights is not new. But it evolved during the past years beyond our operations to also encompass our extended supply chain and product lifecycle.</p>
  <p>In <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2016/01/a8c6d366-577c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html">the latest update of our Global Human Rights Commitment Statement</a>, we have expanded the description of our downstream action areas and how we aim to avoid negative impacts that can result from the use or abuse of SAP’s products and services. We added an entirely new chapter on the implementation of human rights due diligence at SAP, elaborating in detail on our procedures, including governance, risk analysis and prioritized risks, preventive measures, complaints process and remediation, monitoring and reporting, and stakeholder dialog. It makes transparent the results of our human rights due diligence project and helps us better meet the requirements by the UN GPs as well as the German Supply Chain Act.</p>
  <h3 id="q-speaking-about-the-human-rights-impacts-through-the-use-of-sap-solutions-where-do-you-see-the-biggest-risks-and-opportunities-at-the-moment">Q: Speaking about the human rights impacts through the use of SAP solutions, where do you see the biggest risks and opportunities at the moment?</h3>
  <p><strong>SR:</strong> As part of SAP’s downstream human rights due diligence, we have identified <a href="/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) as high impact solution area in the context of human rights. It’s also been frequently addressed as key topic throughout the recent UN Forum on Business and Human Rights in Geneva. AI is transforming our economy and society. This trend is expected to accelerate in the coming years, bringing new opportunities and challenges for society and human rights. SAP actively addresses legitimate concerns, coming up with new AI technology through <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2018/09/940c6047-1c7d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html">SAP’s Guiding Principles for AI Ethics</a> and dedicated due diligence governance, processes, and the <a href="https://www.sap.com/sustainability/our-approach/reporting-and-policies.html?pdf-asset=a8431b91-117e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b&#x26;page=1&#x26;source=social-atw-mailto#policies">SAP Global AI Ethics Policy</a>. In addition, we have started to investigate human rights risks and mitigation measures in our upstream supply chain linked to the outsourcing of generative AI training.</p>
  <p><strong>DS:</strong> On the other hand, I also see the opportunity for SAP to advance human rights by developing innovative solutions that help customers embed human rights into their business and supply chain strategies. This includes our supply chain management solution that offers risk mapping based on financial as well as sustainability indicators, which also cover human rights aspects. Our human resource management solutions furthermore provide tools and features to address unconscious bias in recruitment and hiring, support inclusivity, and ensure equitable remuneration and career advancement. Finally, there is also the opportunity to leverage corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs to advance economic, societal, and cultural rights that support youth-in-need to thrive in the sustainable and digital economy. A prime example of our efforts is SAP Educate to Employ, targeting youth-in-need aged 14 to 30 with skill-building programs to bring them into jobs in the broad SAP ecosystem and beyond by linking education with employability within a sustainable and digital economy.</p>

Against this backdrop, how is SAP doing compared to others?</h3>
  <p><strong>DS:</strong> In my conversations with customers and peers in leading sustainability positions, compliance with human rights legislation definitely comes up as a key priority. However, I also notice that companies continue to struggle to manage their social effects. It did not really surprise me, when I read that a 2022 Economist survey revealed that companies haven’t made as much progress on social as on environmental issues, and only 36% had incorporated social impact into corporate strategy compared with 47% for environmental. This shows that we still have a way to go.</p>
  <p><strong>SR:</strong> Indeed! According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), 160 million children are still engaged in child labor. More than 27 million people around the world are in conditions of forced labor. And globally, 2.4 billion women of working-age are still not afforded equal economic opportunity. These are just some numbers that underline the need for more action by businesses.</p>
  <p>The good news is that mandatory human rights due diligence helps get more companies on board and strengthen the efforts of those that already are. There is good and open exchange and mutual learning among companies. It therefore seems less of a competition in which one enterprise strives to outperform the others. You rather share experiences and gain insights where you are already doing really well and where you can further improve.</p>
  <p>Overall, I would say that SAP has been progressing well and is on track but can still do even better. Our ambition definitely is to not limit ourselves to compliance with mandatory human rights due diligence, but to go beyond.</p>
  <h3 id="q-looking-into-the-future-what-trends-and-challenges-do-you-see">Q: Looking into the future, what trends and challenges do you see?</h3>
  <p><strong>DS:</strong> I believe that the momentum for taking respect for human rights seriously in business will further increase, driven not only by legislative pressure but also increasing stakeholder expectations. It’s important, however, that we as business leaders do not get consumed by navigating the regulatory landscape and ensuring compliance. Let’s not allow this to become a check-box exercise — we must keep people in the center. The aim is to improve people’s lives.</p>
  <p><strong>SR:</strong> I fully agree. Some of the legislation does keep you very busy with a lot of administrative burden. This unfortunately takes away your attention and resources from ultimately making a difference for the affected people. I also see a risk that because value chains are becoming ever more complex with reliable data missing and because managing the human rights risks down to tier-n can seem so overwhelming, companies chose to prioritize de-risking. They rather pull out of high-risk countries which may actually worsen the human rights situation. The increasing complexity of geopolitical crises and need for heightened due diligence further exacerbates this risk.</p>
  <p>As companies mature in human rights due diligence, they will need improved databases and methodologies to help them measure their actual and potential impacts on people, prioritize their efforts and assess the effectiveness of the preventive and remedial measures they put in place. We are testing some of the approaches for SAP at the moment and I am hopeful that they will help guide us toward achieving better outcomes both for people as well as for our business.</p>

        <h1 id="how-the-cloud-and-ai-will-help-more-companies-become-future-proof">How the Cloud and AI Will Help More Companies Become Future Proof</h1>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>When speaking with IT leaders from the world’s largest companies about their greatest business challenges, there’s one thing I hear often. They all want to be future proof, where their operations become more flexible and resilient so they can bounce back faster to unforeseen challenges.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It’s easy to see why. In a world where macroeconomic uncertainty has become the new normal, being future proof is no longer a “nice to have.” It’s a must have. One of the ways that many companies are getting there is by becoming smarter and more strategic about their IT planning and preparing for an AI-powered future.</p>
  <p>I’m sure you’ve heard the phrase, “Work smarter, not harder.” The same is true when it comes to resiliency planning.</p>
  <p>Businesses can become more resilient in many ways, from optimizing production with supply chain planning to better leveraging data to diversifying their suppliers, as well as by giving their workforce new tools and training to become future ready. While organizations always need to be able to respond quickly to operational disruptions and have a flexible contingency plan in place, true resiliency comes from being able to forecast and anticipate disruptions before they happen to avoid them altogether.</p>
  <p>Today, businesses have a golden opportunity to do this by moving their ERP systems to the cloud. Among many other benefits, the cloud allows them to react faster to the unexpected, scale their operations without requiring massive investments in hardware, and make it easier for teams to collaborate when troubleshooting a problem. We all saw a global case study in how the cloud can support resiliency when the pandemic hit in 2020. Companies that had moved their operations to the cloud were able to pivot far faster to the new realities of having a workforce that couldn’t be together physically.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">

        <h3 id="see-how-companies-like-yours-are-succeeding-with-innovative-products-services-and-technologies-from-sap">See how companies like yours are succeeding with innovative products, services, and technologies from SAP</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/about/customer-stories.html">Read their stories</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In my role at SAP, every day I see plenty of examples of customers using the cloud to work smarter and make their businesses more resilient.</p>
  <p>Take, for instance, Nestlé S.A, which has been in business for more than 150 years. The company produces some of the most beloved brands in food, beverages, and nutritional products around the world. It has been an SAP customer for over 20 years and recently selected RISE with SAP to transform in the cloud. As a result, they’ll be able to automate processes across operations, create innovative business models at scale, and achieve greater agility and resilience.</p>
  <p>We’ve also worked with Watco, a leading transportation and logistics provider, to streamline its financial planning, forecasting, and reporting processes. SAP Analytics Cloud helped the company get access to a profit and loss account for each of its 200 individual locations as well as a comprehensive, consolidated company view. It has connected 320 team members, allowing them to collaborate on enterprise plans with one source of information across their locations to be better prepared for the unexpected.</p>
  <p>But this is just the beginning. While having ERP systems in the cloud is essential for making any business future proof, the benefits become even greater when <a href="/topics/artificial-intelligence">AI</a> solutions are also built right into cloud solutions. AI promises to be a force multiplier. Together with the cloud, business AI has the potential to help companies become true systems of intelligence where speed and agility meet data and insight.</p>
  <p>Every journey is different. But there is simply no doubt that businesses that are willing to invest in the latest cloud and business AI solutions with a trusted partner like SAP will be able to future proof in ways that were previously unimaginable. And this is the most important thing they can do to thrive in an uncertain world.</p>
  <p>In 2023, we saw what is possible when generative AI for business is specifically tailored to the unique business context of the company using it. With this in mind, I’m predicting that because of the <a href="/2023/12/generative-ai-show-me-the-money-moment">growing power of generative AI</a> for business — especially when it is embedded in ways that are relevant, reliable, and responsible — 2024 will be a watershed year for resiliency planning.</p>
  <p>Those who are willing to make it central to their transformation journeys will open themselves up to new models and revenue streams that will become proof of their future promise.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Data is among the most valuable assets of SAP customers and partners, with the power to enhance strategic decision-making and ensure competitive advantage. However, privacy and security concerns immediately arise when collecting and processing sensitive data.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This is why SAP and Bosch have joined forces to harness the power of secure multi-party computation (MPC) and help enable secure and privacy-preserving data analysis across different organizations and industries.</p>
  <h2 id="bringing-secure-computation-to-the-industry-level">Bringing Secure Computation to the Industry Level</h2>
  <p>MPC is an advanced cryptographic technique that can offer significant benefits to SAP customers and partners that often deal with sensitive data from various sources and stakeholders. MPC allows multiple parties to jointly perform a computation without revealing any sensitive information that may be contained in their input data.</p>
  <p>That’s a great achievement because companies often fear that the risk of sharing their data openly is greater than the potential value of the sharing itself. One example is the supply chain, where multiple parties are involved. Object-level tracking allows companies to collect large amounts of data, such as time, location, or handling of the goods they produce. Combining the data collected by the different companies involved can have significant benefits. However, two companies may only be willing to share information about common items that they have both handled along the supply chain. MPC can help solve this dilemma with secure and private computation.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>As a result, organizations can perform complex data analysis and processing without compromising confidentiality or compliance. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-05-31-gartner-identifies-top-five-trends-in-privacy-through-2024">Gartner</a> predicts that by 2025, 60% of large organizations will use at least one privacy-enhancing computation technique in analytics, business intelligence, or cloud computing.</p>
  <p>“Companies can thrive the most when collaborating in business networks, and sharing data is a key component of these ecosystems. MPC can help protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and misuse while still enabling valuable insights and analytics,” says Volkmar Lotz, head of SAP Security Research at <a href="https://www.sap.com/about/company/innovation/icn.html">SAP Innovation Center Network</a>. Powering secure benchmarking, fraud detection, supply chain optimization, or personalized services, MPC facilitates data sharing and collaboration across different organizations and sectors, creating new opportunities for innovation and growth.</p>
  <h2 id="lifting-mpc-into-the-cloud">Lifting MPC into the Cloud</h2>
  <p>In response to the demand for greater data privacy, Bosch Research has initiated the open-source project <a href="https://carbynestack.io/">Carbyne Stack</a>, which makes MPC available for a cloud environment. This way, confidentiality and privacy are maintained when data is processed by cloud services.</p>
  <p>“Carbyne Stack is a kind of cloud-native operating system for MPC workloads, managing resources to make them run as efficiently as possible in multi-cloud deployments,” explains Sven Trieflinger, senior project manager and group lead at Bosch Research. “From a business perspective, it’s the seed for an upcoming open ecosystem of technology building blocks that will accelerate the development and adoption of MPC technology across multiple industries.”</p>
  <p>SAP has recently joined Carbyne Stack as a contributor. Building on both partners’ leadership in <a href="/topics/data-security">data security</a>, cloud computing, and business applications, the collaboration will explore the potential of MPC for various use cases and industries currently constrained by security and privacy concerns. One of the first topics for SAP will be to make the Carbyne Stack storage and processing services easily consumable from within the browser and to add support for deploying Carbyne Stack on Amazon Web Services (AWS). These changes will help SAP work towards its vision of providing services for privacy-preserving data operations across different organizations and sectors, creating new opportunities for innovative business cases.</p>
  <p>“By combining the strengths of SAP and Bosch, we aim to advance the state of the art in MPC and enable new business cases for our customers and partners,” says Lotz.</p>
  <p>SAP targets use cases in industries such as automotive, manufacturing, healthcare, and finance. The exploration of MPC’s potential holds the opportunity to revolutionize those industries by solving critical data privacy and security challenges without compromising collaboration and innovation.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Most organizations are at a critical juncture with their data. They recognize the importance of harnessing data intelligently. But using 80% to 90% of that useful information – primarily hidden in unstructured sources such as e-mails, customer chats, phone calls, invoices, videos, and other digital artifacts – is increasingly challenging.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>When lacking the structure of metadata or attributes necessary for application, algorithm, and machine utilization, data is not only left unused but also accumulates in high volumes. This data management approach inevitably exacerbates IT complexity and consumes valuable storage resources. And even worse, organizations need insights that cannot be found elsewhere.</p>
  <p>A <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/08/9cbf9a15-897e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Process Excellence Network</a> report, co-sponsored by SAP, reveals that some organizations are addressing this challenge by embracing intelligent document processing (IDP) technology. Enriched with <a href="/topics/ai">AI</a> capabilities, this next-generation tool is becoming a vital ally for process optimization, innovation, and delivering exceptional user experiences.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-intelligent-document-processing">What Is Intelligent Document Processing?</h2>
  <p>Unlike traditional template-based approaches, IDP solutions employ computer vision and natural language processing to scan documents containing unstructured data, such as invoices, receipts, and contracts. The information on these documents is then extracted using a combination of robotic process automation (RPA) and machine learning to help ensure accuracy and integrated into larger business systems. Finally, all this information is converted into machine-readable data and interpreted into actionable insights.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">

        <h3 id="go-from-analytics-to-action-with-ai-powered-intelligent-document-processing">Go from analytics to action with AI-powered intelligent document processing</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2023/09/6a11431a-8f7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Watch the webinar</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It’s essential to note that IDP goes beyond mere document reading, decoding, and translation. It also accelerates data use by improving processing accuracy and providing immediate access for humans and machines. The extracted information is contextually aligned with business rules, integrated into downstream systems like SAP S/4HANA Cloud, and applied to real-world process automation, business scenarios, and decision-making.</p>
  <p>However, the real advantage of such streamlined, document-centric processes becomes more evident when they align with an organization’s competitive goals, stepping up decision-making speed and unlocking valuable data-driven insights.</p>

  <p>An <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/01/629d79f0-127e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">IDC business value white paper</a> reported that IDP solutions – such as <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/enterprise-content-management.html">SAP enterprise content management (ECM) solutions by OpenText</a> – help bridge content silos and reduce frustration and time by expediting information flow while expanding governance. As a result, organizations using the technology can experience profound team productivity improvement and extensibility across the globe, making it easier to work from anywhere and at any time.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2021/03/5040f854-d67d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html">Old World Industries LLC</a> (OWI), which sells motor oil, antifreeze, fuel additives, and other automotive chemicals in more than 60 countries, is a prime example of a business experiencing similar operational upgrades. The company implemented the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/financial-management/invoice-management.html">SAP Invoice Management application by OpenText</a> as part of the SAP ECM solutions by OpenText portfolio to bring the speed that customers associate with its brands to its accounts payable processes. This strategic move eliminated the roadblocks that manual processes dependent on paper and e-mail posed to OWI’s overall efficiency, especially as the workforce continued to work remotely.</p>
  <p>By integrating SAP Invoice Management with its existing accounts payable applications, OWI advanced its journey toward finance digitalization with embedded AI technologies, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Machine learning</strong> technology that can analyze documents and bypass error-prone data-entry steps</li>
    <li><strong>Character recognition</strong> capabilities to help automatically flag duplicate invoices and detect invoicing and payment errors</li>
    <li><strong>A centralized point of control and access</strong>, which can provide a unified user experience across accounts payable applications for data access, analysis, collaboration, and decision-making</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to fast-tracking its invoicing processes, the IDP application enabled OWI’s accounts payable employees to prioritize their workload, shifting their attention from data entry to timely invoice validation and resolution. And now that detailed histories of invoices are available all in one place, the team can analyze individual vendors in a few clicks to identify opportunities and mitigate potential risks early.</p>

  <p>Based on IDC’s survey of organizations using SAP ECM solutions by OpenText, the combined benefits of content digitalization, automation, and integration can lead to annual revenue growth of over US$7 million.</p>
  <p>This remarkable outcome comes with an added gain of 4,794 productive hours, increasing gross business productivity by 21%. Furthermore, enhanced interdepartmental document sharing and process automation contributed to an even greater boost in profitability, with savings of $3.82 million for every set of 1 million documents.</p>
  <h2 id="why-the-value-of-idp-technology-continues-to-build">Why the Value of IDP Technology Continues to Build</h2>
  <p>Echoing similar advantages reported by IDC, the Process Excellence Network predicts that future advancements in AI will further strengthen the fundamental value of IDP solutions. This is particularly apparent with recent innovations in generative AI, encompassing deep-learning models capable of producing text, images, videos, and diverse content.</p>
  <p>By embracing generative AI, for example, IDP can be poised to transcend structured data extraction to generate high-quality, context-sensitive content and augment the swiftness and precision of data processing. It will soon empower large language models – such as chatbots and voice user interfaces – to yield profound, contextually rich insights that can be applied for automated decision-making and content generation.</p>
  <p>As one survey respondent says, “The combination of IDP and generative AI will further enhance our content automation capabilities, enabling us to automate complex document generation tasks and deliver personalized and tailored experiences to our customers.”</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>When we look back on 2023, we’ll remember it as a year when economic conditions put the spotlight back on cost containment. At the same time, spend management professionals continued to face unexpected supply chain risks and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) requirements created more pressure to comply with government regulations and consumer demands.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It was also the year when business leaders worldwide decided enough is enough. They began taking steps to future proof their supply chains. And we can’t forget that 2023 was the year when generative <a href="/topics/ai">AI</a> came to dominate every conversation about technology.</p>
  <p>Now it’s time to look ahead. Where will world events, business developments, and technology innovations take spend management in 2024? What strategies and technology will business leaders employ to bring greater resilience and efficiency to their supply chains?</p>
  <p>Here are predictions for 2024, from SAP’s intelligent spend and business network leaders.</p>
  <div class="article-footnote">
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>“In 2023, generative AI was like a bolt of lightning that compelled every business and technology leader to sit up and take notice. We’re no longer asking <em>if</em> businesses will adopt AI technology, but rather <em>how quickly</em> they can deploy it and realize its benefits. In 2024, businesses leaders will look beyond the industry buzz for solutions that deliver real-life, AI-based use cases. They’ll also see firsthand that AI is only as effective as the quality and availability of data. With the huge number of data and transactions running through our <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/spend-management/solutions.html?campaigncode=CRM-Y123-ISM-1980086&#x26;source=blog-glo-2024ISBNPredictions">systems</a> and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network.html?campaigncode=CRM-Y123-ISM-1980086&#x26;source=blog-glo-2024ISBNPredictions">business network</a>, SAP is uniquely positioned to help organizations access the data they need, visualize it, and take decisive action to drive their success.”</p>
        <p>– <em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-s-alam/">Muhammad Alam</a>, President and Chief Product Officer,</em><br><em>SAP Intelligent Spend and Business Network,</em><br><em>and General Manager for SAP Business Network</em></p>
        <p>“As we enter 2024, procurement organizations will continue to focus on cost containment and supply continuity in order to bring value to their businesses. These have traditionally been the primary value drivers and, in today’s economic environment, I see this continuing. The opportunity will be maintaining the expanded voice earned with stakeholders during the volatile, crisis-riddled past few years, given the resurgence of hyper focus on cost containment. I believe that the scope of procurement will not contract back to a sole focus on supply stability and cost containment. In fact, I think procurement’s remit will continue to evolve to lead broader supply chain risk management, given the growing variety and number of risks faced such as geopolitical tensions, sustainability expectations, the need for more diverse sources of supply, and lingering labor availability concerns. The challenge facing procurement will be how to tackle all of this successfully. What we’ll see is the use of innovation like generative AI, spend analysis, and category management solutions to not only provide relevant, real-time business insights, but, importantly, to increase the efficiency and productivity of procurement teams, giving more capacity to focus on the strategic work stakeholders now expect.”</p>
        <p>– <em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/etoshathurman/">Etosha Thurman</a>, Chief Marketing and Solutions Officer,</em><br><em>Intelligent Spend and Business Network, SAP</em></p>
        <p>“The more things change, the more they stay the same. Or do they? Last year we were talking about how businesses needed to grapple with economic, political, and environmental uncertainty. That hasn’t changed. What’s different is how quickly new strategies and technologies have emerged to help businesses deal with these challenges. In 2024, I expect business leaders to continue pursuing supply chain resilience and to look for solutions such as AI that enable them to make big leaps. There will also be a continued focus on cost savings. With economic concerns looming as central banks raise funds rates to counter inflation, I foresee leaders being asked to deliver higher margins for their enterprises. To do this, traditional cost-focused sourcing and procurement cost compliance will be essential.”</p>
        <p>– <em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffcollier/">Jeff Collier</a>, Chief Revenue Officer,</em><br><em>Intelligent Spend and Business Network, SAP</em></p>
        <p>“As enterprises continue on their journey to digitalize procurement processes, the need for an even more intuitive user experience will increase. Procurement professionals are looking for ways to spend more time on value-adding tasks and are looking to generative AI and analytics to support them at the point of decision. Moving into 2024 and beyond, we expect the demand for these technologies to increase, as well as for new use cases to arise. At SAP, we are already evaluating further ways to embed generative AI and analytics into solutions throughout our SAP Ariba portfolio to help make our customers’ business lives easier than ever.”</p>
        <p>– <em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/salvatore-lombardo-a579662/">Salvatore Lombardo</a>, SVP, Chief Product Officer,</em><br><em>SAP Ariba Procurement Solutions, SAP</em></p>
        <p>“As technology evolves, pragmatic business leaders are looking for ways to leverage these new developments to help streamline and simplify their processes. Managing a workforce that can be comprised of up to 40% external workers demands tools that can simplify the user experience and offer broad visibility to both external and full-time workers. I predict that in 2024 we will see more organizations lean into total workforce management strategies to address this need for greater visibility across full-time and external workers, allowing businesses to align the skills they have with the work they need to complete. Along with a more holistic approach to managing their workforce, these same companies can leverage innovative AI tools designed to offer efficiencies and improve the user experience. In 2024, SAP Fieldglass customers will be able to leverage powerful AI tools, including AI-enhanced statement of work creation, translation capabilities, and our new <a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2023/10/e8cd2e18-937e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">job description builder</a> powered by generative AI. These offerings are just the beginning, with many more use cases to come.”</p>
        <p>– <em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishbaliga/">Vish Baliga</a>, Chief Technology Officer,</em><br><em>SAP Fieldglass Solutions, SAP</em></p>
        <p>“In my conversations with customers and prospects about their plans for 2024, they consistently voice concerns about supply chain disruption and economic uncertainty. Meanwhile, most seem to appreciate that artificial intelligence is vital to maintaining their competitive edge, yet many are unsure how to distinguish the actual value from the ample hype. In 2024, we will see more of the value that AI can deliver to organizations with capabilities to support their value chains. These include generative and predictive AI capabilities to help forecast disruptions, recommend alternate sources of raw materials, detect errors in invoices, extract pertinent data from requests for information, predict shipment and delivery times, and complete catalogue details. Trading partners need the ability to enter into additional collaborative relationships, such as those between buyers and suppliers spanning SAP Business Network Supply Chain Collaboration and material traceability and freight collaboration solutions. Also in 2024, we see network convergence taking center stage to give organizations a shared onboarding experience across all network applications, as well as a set of common data federation services to support data residency requirements.”</p>
        <p>– <em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joernkeller/">Joern Keller</a>, Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer,</em><br><em>SAP Business Network</em></p>
        <p>“In 2024, generative AI will deliver trillions in economic benefits. It will help companies realize greater top-line growth, be more productive, and safeguard supply chains. At the same time, resiliency will continue to be a major focus. The combination of AI and business networks will drive game-changing resiliency and productivity by facilitating improved demand forecasting and more efficient inventory management. These technologies will empower businesses to respond proactively to market changes, allowing them to source new suppliers quickly. In times of supply chain disruptions or demand surges, the nimblest companies will benefit most. Business networks will help them anticipate challenges with real-time information sharing and enhanced supply chain visibility. And there’s more good news for midmarket and smaller companies: as enterprise adoption of these technologies may begin to lag behind due to complex and unique use cases, segments like the midmarket and smaller companies will start to gain the competitive edge, building more resilient, predictable, and sustainable supply chains at scale.”</p>
        <p>– <em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/valerie-blatt-3790091/">Val Blatt</a>, Global Head, SAP Business Network</em><br><em>Customer Success and Go-to-Market, SAP</em></p>
        <p>“We’ll see business digitalization efforts go a level deeper – and become substantially more integrated – in 2024. Continued adoption of AI, automation, and virtual forms of payment will drive streamlined processes in travel, expense, and invoice. Instead of using a company credit card, employees will be able to expand their use of virtual payments for all business expenses, including travel. In turn, we’ll start to see two types of transactions emerge: trusted and exceptions. Most transactions will use trusted payment methods, and AI will quickly validate them as compliant, enabling near-immediate reimbursement. Exceptions will trigger AI-driven, automated audits to ensure compliance. In both cases, payments will be issued faster with more ease, and employees will have more time to focus on what matters most to them and the organization.”</p>

  <p>“After another year of significant disruption caused by economic and geopolitical uncertainty, supply chain optimization has risen up the agenda as companies seek to better manage their working capital. Embedded finance has emerged as a solution, promising to reshape the way we do business and interact. Embedded finance has the power to expedite transactions, facilitate financing between trading partners, and lower trade barriers. By harnessing embedded finance, companies have the potential to optimize processes and access financing solutions seamlessly through B2B platforms. Ultimately, this will result in more streamlined payments, faster credit decisions, and expanded access to working capital.”</p>
  <p>– <em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dweinblatt/">Danielle Weinblatt</a>, Chief Product Officer, Taulia</em></p>
  <p>“As organizations, especially midmarket companies, continue to navigate today’s dynamic business environment, they are realizing the need to work with solution partners to create more value for their customers and themselves. A strong relationship between organizations and their partner ecosystems is critical to success, and I expect we will continue to see more businesses, both large and small, looking to establish these relationships. With the cost of managing sustainable supply chains continuing to increase, companies should turn to their partner ecosystems to leverage their expertise, skills, and services. This approach can help unify a company’s operations to provide a greater experience for its buyers and sellers, enabling stronger collaboration, greater visibility and transparency, risk mitigation, and more efficient operations.”</p>

  <h2 id="one-more-prediction">One More Prediction</h2>
  <p>Recent times have shown that unexpected disruptions aren’t the only reason businesses struggle in times of crisis. It’s also about their readiness to deal with disruption, to adapt, and to come out stronger when the crisis subsides. Many business leaders have learned this lesson. They’re taking action to ensure – to the best of their ability – that their businesses are prepared for what comes next.</p>
  <p>Of course, that’s easier said than done. Sometimes it feels like we need a crystal ball to see into the future. Or, to use a more common term, we need “visibility.” Visibility into market trends. Visibility into world events. Visibility into every corner of the supply chain.</p>
  <p>Here’s a prediction you can take to the bank: in 2024, SAP will continue to design and deliver <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/spend-management/solutions.html?campaigncode=CRM-Y123-ISM-1980086&#x26;source=blog-glo-2024ISBNPredictions">spend management</a> and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network.html?campaigncode=CRM-Y123-ISM-1980086&#x26;source=blog-glo-2024ISBNPredictions">business network</a> solutions that can drive efficiency, leverage AI in ways that are relevant, reliable, and responsible, and create greater visibility for every size business.</p>
