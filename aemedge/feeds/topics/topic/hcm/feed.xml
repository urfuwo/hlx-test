  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Today, SAP is thrilled to announce more than 6,000 organizations have chosen SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central, our cloud HRIS software, to help elevate their core HR operations. This milestone demonstrates strong momentum in the SAP SuccessFactors community, which includes leaders and business users that are driving strategies that put people at the center of business.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>People and culture are increasingly becoming some of the most critical aspects of an organization. It’s what attracts new talent to join and keeps current employees growing and developing. Whether that’s scaling up, diving into a new market segment, or pivoting to meet changing customer demands, having the right people in the right roles determines success.</p>
  <p>From midsize organizations to large enterprises, having a single view of employees across all countries is a differentiator. It’s no longer about just maintaining a system of record. It’s <em>the</em> foundation to manage the total workforce – from setting organizational goals to establishing the talent intelligence that’s needed to build a workforce that is agile and adaptable.</p>
  <p>Organizations of all sizes, industries, and regions use SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central to help improve experiences for managers and employees, automate compliance for more than 100 locales, manage benefits and absence management, and standardize processes across multiple locations.

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div><a href="https://www.colesgroup.com.au/home/">Coles Group</a>, one of Australia’s most trusted and iconic brands, is steadfast in delivering on its purpose to help Australians eat and live better every day. Through its core business as a full-service supermarket retailer, Coles engages with millions of customers every week in its 860 supermarkets throughout Australia. The group’s other areas of business include its Click &#x26; Collect online platform, network of liquor stores, and financial services with nearly 1,000 additional retail outlets.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Guided by the organization’s clear <a href="https://colescareers.com.au/au/en/culture">vision, purpose, and strategy</a>, Coles’ team of 120,000 employees is dedicated to making a difference in the lives of customers and the local communities it serves.</p>
  <p>In fiscal year 2020/21, Coles Group hired nearly 30,000 people to deliver on its business needs. Mike Virgo, head of Talent Acquisition for Coles Group, said this hiring volume was necessary to make sure the company was “positioned well to support our customers.”</p>
  <p>The business environment, however, dramatically shifted as the public health crisis of the pandemic unfolded, resulting in repeated lockdowns and restrictions. As a neighborhood retailer dependent on in-person interaction to deliver most of its services, Coles found its workforce impacted by the pandemic. Faced with supply chain disruptions, panic buying behaviors by consumers, high employee absenteeism, and increased turnover, Coles urgently needed to step up its volume and pace of hiring to support its customers.</p>

  <p>“Around 2020-2021, we started to experience one of the most significant shifts in the employment market we’d ever seen,” Virgo said in a <a href="https://go3.events.sap.com/successconnect/virtual/2023/reg/flow/sap/sc23/catalog/page/catalog/session/1693098679863001ykJ6">session</a> at <a href="https://www.sap.com/events/successconnect/virtual.html?campaigncode=CRM-YI23-HXM-2055448&#x26;source=text-glo-SAPNews">SuccessConnect Virtual</a>. “It started to create huge challenges for organizations around the world – around how we attract, retain, and hire talent.”</p>
  <h2 id="catalyst-for-change-and-a-new-way-of-working">Catalyst for Change and a New Way of Working</h2>
  <p>To meet pressing business demands, Coles doubled its hiring volume from 30,000 to 60,000 people and increased recruitment advertising spend by a factor of three. Its talent acquisition team grew proportionally to manage the increased workload – but then labored under manual transactional activities that slowed processing times. As a result of the huge strain, variability in the candidate and hiring manager experience became noticeable.</p>
  <p>Due to the volume of work, Coles looked for ways to evolve its system to create more speed, efficiency, and scalability. With a list of criteria, Coles began to review technology solutions on the market to find one that could support its vision for a new way of working. “We wanted to reimagine how we recruit for our stores,” Virgo said. “We needed automation and AI to remove a lot of the manual work in our systems. We wanted to create more consistency and uplift the experiences we were giving our candidates and our hiring managers. And ultimately, [the solution] needed to drive commercial benefit for us.”</p>
  <p>As a key requirement, the new solution needed to integrate with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/what-is-hxm-suite.html">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite</a>. In 2020, as part of an organization-wide <a href="/australia/2021/09/08/how-coles-group-is-transforming-hr-during-the-global-pandemic">digital transformation</a> that introduced SAP S/4HANA and SAP Ariba solutions, Coles modernized its HR and payroll processing, replacing a patchwork of outdated systems with SAP SuccessFactors solutions. It became the first organization in the southern hemisphere to launch all modules of the SAP SuccessFactors portfolio in one go. With all HR processes unified on a single platform, Coles benefits from having a single source of truth for people data that is accurate and available in real time for the entire organization.</p>
  <h2 id="two-way-integration-ensures-single-source-of-truth-in-data">Two-Way Integration Ensures Single Source of Truth in Data</h2>
  <p>To help with the project, Coles chose <a href="https://www.phenom.com/">Phenom</a>, an SAP partner whose AI-powered Intelligent Talent Experience platform provides two-way integration with SAP SuccessFactors solutions. Virgo said the two-way integration “allows us to have a holistic view of the candidates that progress through the process, no matter whether the team is operating in Phenom or SAP SuccessFactors, and it allows SAP SuccessFactors to be our single source of truth.”</p>
  <p>There are several key benefits of Phenom’s solution at Coles. One is candidate attraction and engagement, which is achieved primarily through the Coles career site and chatbot. Another is recruiter automation and interview management, which provides automation and process efficiencies from when a job requisition is created in SAP SuccessFactors solutions and replicated into Phenom until a hiring manager chooses a candidate for the job. Once a candidate is chosen, the two-way integration enables the HR team to access the data in SAP SuccessFactors solutions and complete all compliance aspects, such as working rights, contract generation, and onboarding.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The Coles team gains additional efficiencies in its onboarding programs through the application of robotic process automation (RPA) powered by two bots that work in the background: <em>Ashbotty</em> processes the working rights and <em>Usain Bot</em> processes onboarding and manages pending recruits. “They take a lot of the transactional, manual work that we used to have team members doing. It can do that quickly, accurately, and it can do that 24/7 – which is particularly important for us as a seven-days-a-week business,” Virgo said.</p>
  <h2 id="ai-powered-experiences-for-candidates-and-recruiters">AI-Powered Experiences for Candidates and Recruiters</h2>
  <p>Coles reimagined the candidate experience to launch a modern, tech-enabled career site – which has been chosen as a two-time winner of Australia’s Best Careers Site. The site includes an AI-powered chatbot to guide candidates as they look for information, search relevant job postings, and submit their applications. It also includes Coles’ Expression of Interest, always-on advertising that drives the growth of its talent pool and advances its talent marketing by reducing the need to advertise every role. A Hosted Apply process, facilitated by integrations with Phenom, presents a consistent candidate experience and increases the conversion rate on applications.</p>
  <p>Phenom AI Scheduling, a key part of Coles’ hiring experience, enables candidates to book themselves an available interview slot and automates the coordination of hiring team calendars. The new solution provides a fully mobile-enabled experience to meet the demands of candidates for an omni-channel, real-time experience where they can learn, read, and apply for jobs where and when they want.</p>
  <p>Inundated by nearly 1 million applications each year to review, Coles also took steps to elevate the recruiter experience and increase the speed and accuracy of candidate screening and job matching. It implemented Phenom Fit Score, an AI-powered feature that assesses a candidate’s suitability for an open role, based on location and optimal travel distances, availability, and working rights; then, assigns a fit score and surfaces the most closely matched candidates to the recruiters. In addition, the new solution empowers in-store managers to collaborate with recruiters to review candidates and make quick hiring decisions with confidence.</p>
  <h2 id="talent-pools-grow-with-improvements-to-hiring-speed-and-efficiency">Talent Pools Grow with Improvements to Hiring Speed and Efficiency</h2>
  <p>With the new augmented solution, Coles is experiencing tangible benefits across multiple categories and key metrics for success: time-to-fill is down six days; time-to-hire is down two days, which is impressive considering candidates can book the in-store interview up to two weeks in advance; and advertising spend is down 50%.</p>
  <p>Most notably for Coles as a people-centric organization is the development of its talent pool, now numbering 2 million potential candidates. It achieves an 85% application conversion rate on up to 1 million applications per year. Through its <a href="https://www.colesgroup.com.au/media-releases/?page=coles-group-ranked-1-for-recruitment-of-aussies-with-disabilities">commitment</a> to be a safe, inclusive, and diverse workplace, Coles has applied the new solution to provide greater accessibility for more diverse candidates, resulting in an increase of 24% more hiring for people who identify as having a disability.</p>
  <p>Virgo said that the talent acquisition team will continue to evolve its solution and assess more opportunities for AI and automation to bring value to the recruitment process. Although these technologies are not cure-alls for every recruitment scenario, they can save recruiting teams precious time and resources to focus on more high-touch interactions further down the recruiting funnel. In sharing lessons learned, Virgo noted, “I think the important call out is the level of automation you can inject in your process will likely diminish as the seniority, complexity, and requirements of your roles increase because they are likely to be more high touch, perhaps need more interpretation or judgment calls from your recruiters to identify who the right talent is for your organization.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>In today’s rapidly evolving corporate landscape, diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEI&#x26;B) have become essential in fostering a thriving organizational culture. SAP leads the way in leveraging technology to enhance DEI&#x26;B initiatives, tailoring user experiences (UX) to help meet the unique needs of a diverse global workforce.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Our team of <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/successfactors/growth-insights-research/growth-insights-team">organizational psychology scientists</a> conducts ongoing research on the evolving landscape of work, workplaces, and technology. This research, along with customer feedback and our commitment to accessibility for all users, helps us design solutions that can meet your employees’ needs and enhance your organization’s DEI&#x26;B efforts.</p>
  <p>Let’s explore five key ways in which SAP’s focus on UX helps organizations advance their DEI&#x26;B strategies by offering employees an interface that can address their needs in the flow of work.</p>
  <h2 id="experiences-designed-for-employee-preferences">1. Experiences Designed for Employee Preferences</h2>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="get-powerful-cloud-hr-software-that-empowers-individuals-to-reach-their-full-potential">Get powerful cloud HR software that empowers individuals to reach their full potential</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm.html">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>A core principle of UX is designing with a user-centered approach. SAP SuccessFactors solutions allow personalization for users with different backgrounds, abilities, and preferences, helping to ensure everyone can benefit. For example, <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2023/10/26/exciting-news-for-sap-successfactors-learning-in-2h2023-the-new-integrated-learning-experience-is-now-generally-available/">SAP SuccessFactors Learning</a> offers individualized, AI-generated learning recommendations that can prioritize courses based on individual goals, skills, and organizational objectives and categorize them into “need,” “want,” and “must” sections. The <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/succession-development.html">SAP SuccessFactors Succession &#x26; Development</a> solution can enable individuals to identify skill gaps against target roles within their career path and take ownership of their career development planning.</p>
  <h2 id="cultural-sensitivity-and-awareness">2. Cultural Sensitivity and Awareness</h2>
  <p>We recognize that many organizations operate on a global scale, with diverse cultural norms and practices. Our solutions can accommodate diverse cultural contexts, helping to promote inclusivity and reduce the risk of exclusion and discrimination in a global context. With localization options, users can have experiences tailored to their needs. For example, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/employee-central-hris.html">SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central</a> can enable your employees to record their name pronunciation and post it to their profile for others to access. This helps ensure colleagues can address them accurately and confidently in meetings. <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/performance-goals.html">SAP SuccessFactors Performance &#x26; Goals</a> includes cultural competency as a performance parameter, promoting awareness and sensitivity to cultural differences in interactions and work.</p>
  <h2 id="systemic-bias-mitigation">3. Systemic Bias Mitigation</h2>
  <p>SAP SuccessFactors solutions help combat biases in hiring, promotions, and decision-making. Our UX focus helps promote inclusivity by using non-discriminatory language and content, aligning with organizational efforts to help eliminate bias. Our <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2023/11/01/2h-2023-release-highlights-boost-hiring-experiences-with-the-latest-sap-successfactors-recruiting-innovations-and-enhancements/">generative AI</a> technology can support your organization in creating job postings equitably with gender bias detection and providing AI-generated, recommended interview questions based on details from the job description to help ensure the interview process is more objective and focused on assessing candidates’ skills and qualifications only. Employees can also add their preferred pronouns to their profile for respectful and identity-aligned addressing by colleagues.</p>

  </div>
  <h2 id="designing-for-accessibility">4. Designing for Accessibility</h2>
  <p>We prioritize <a href="https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/accessibility-in-sap-fiori/">accessibility in our product design</a> to help ensure inclusivity for all users. Our products are designed to accommodate your employees’ diverse needs, with features such as screen readers, keyboard support, text resize to 200%, and text spacing with no loss of meaningful information. These inclusive experiences can empower every user to navigate the application without compromising the integrity of content, functionality, or efficiency.</p>
  <h2 id="data-collection-and-privacy">5. Data Collection and Privacy</h2>
  <p>Ensuring absolute transparency and unwavering privacy is essential when it comes to data collection and protection. Our commitment to these principles includes incorporating AI explainability into our policies, which means that your employees not only have control over their data but also can understand how our AI systems make decisions, helping to prevent unintentional discrimination. Our <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/talent-management.html">talent management solutions</a> help ensure data privacy by anonymizing and aggregating information in compliance with regulations. This includes masking individual data, combining it with other information, and incorporating features like consent management, data access controls, and data retention policies. Furthermore, with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/workforce-analytics.html">SAP SuccessFactors Workforce Analytics</a>, you can analyze diversity and inclusion patterns and trends without compromising individual privacy, fostering a climate of trust and data integrity.</p>
  <p>SAP is committed to UX and DEI&#x26;B alignment to create inclusive workplaces. With ongoing research, adaptability, and cutting-edge design, SAP SuccessFactors solutions can empower organizations to drive DEI&#x26;B success and foster a culture of belonging.

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Employee potential is at the center of all people practices as it requires assessing individuals’ skills, capabilities, and growth prospects. HR technology can help organizations make informed decisions about recruitment, development, work allocation, internal mobility, succession planning, and more. It helps organizations consider not only what an employee can do today, but also what they could be capable of in the future, helping to unlock the potential in their workforce.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To understand the future of employee potential, the <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/successfactors/growth-insights-research">Growth &#x26; Insights team</a> for SAP SuccessFactors hosted interviews with 57 HR leaders from SAP customer organizations and conducted a survey of 1,401 individual contributors from around the globe. The research focused on defining, assessing, and utilizing potential.</p>
  <h2 id="expanding-the-definition-of-employee-potential">Expanding the Definition of Employee Potential</h2>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="read-the-full-employee-potential-research-report">Read the full employee potential research report</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/cmp/dg/employee-potential/index.html">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Before an organization can assess employee potential, they need to define it. Across the HR leaders we interviewed, definitions of employee potential fell into three different categories: individual attributes, ability to take on a certain role in the future, and current performance. Most HR leaders struggled to find a definition of employee potential that their organizations would accept, understand, or apply universally and consistently. According to the surveyed HR leaders, an expanded definition of potential would give them a more comprehensive understanding of their workforce’s potential; enable managers to better understand, discuss, and realize their team members’ potential; and ensure that employee potential practices are more inclusive of all employees.</p>
  <h2 id="improving-the-assessment-of-employee-potential">Improving the Assessment of Employee Potential</h2>
  <p>The research uncovered many challenges in the process of assessing employee potential, including what is measured, how it is measured, and who is involved. The top challenge in assessing potential was rater subjectivity, or raters using their gut feelings, opinions, or biases to inform their assessments rather than the organization’s definition or criteria. Survey data from employees suggest that HR leaders should be concerned about this bias: about one-third of employees (30%) feel their organizations’ potential practices are unfair.</p>
  <p>One way that organizations can minimize bias in assessment of potential is by leveraging an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered skills foundation like the <a href="/2023/10/skills-based-organization-talent-intelligence-hub">talent intelligence hub</a>. The talent intelligence hub powers <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm.html">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite</a> and can enable organizations to better understand, build, and leverage the skills of their workforces. By understanding individuals’ skills, attributes, strengths, and preferences, organizations can make data-driven talent decisions and minimize biased decision-making.</p>
  <p>AI can also assist in creating personalized development opportunities for employees based on their potential. By knowing an employee’s strengths, skills, and aspirations, AI can recommend targeted training and development opportunities that align with their potential growth areas. <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/talent-management.html?video=c6c01178-6b7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b">SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace</a>, powered by the talent intelligence hub, can surface AI-powered recommendations, such learning courses, project assignments, mentors, and internal roles, that can help nurture and retain high-potential talent.</p>
  <p>Another challenge that was uncovered in the research is that assessments are missing valuable perspectives on employee potential. Our research suggests that managers do not know as much as they want about their direct reports’ potential. This indicates that the manager’s perspective must be supplemented with other sources.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="get-powerful-cloud-hr-software-that-empowers-individuals-to-reach-their-full-potential-at-work">Get powerful cloud HR software that empowers individuals to reach their full potential at work</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm.html">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>According to the HR leaders that we interviewed, peers’ opinions of an employee’s potential are rarely included – only two of the 44 organizations we worked with included peers in a 360-degree assessment of employee potential. According to employees, peers are a valuable data source and are as aware of their potential as their managers are. Having a solution like <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/performance-goals.html">SAP SuccessFactors Performance &#x26; Goals</a> can optimize this process significantly by using 360-degree reviews to help capture a more balanced and complete view of employee evaluations, including peer reviews. Using the 360-degree review forms, skills can be accessed and rated to highlight areas of achievement and opportunities for growth. The selected skills, together with their ratings, are then updated in the employee’s growth portfolio.</p>
  <h2 id="using-employee-potential-more-effectively">Using Employee Potential More Effectively</h2>
  <p>In general, our research suggested that HR leaders currently use potential data to make informed talent decisions in succession planning, career pathing, and performance management. However, HR leaders struggle to use employee potential data consistently across different HR practices. The talent intelligence hub can drive an organization’s entire learning and talent strategy and help use potential data more effectively. Organizations benefit from having a single skills model that covers recruiting, onboarding, learning and development, performance, and succession. With a holistic view of the workforce based on skills data from multiple locations, they can make data-driven <a href="https://www.sap.com/insights/what-is-a-talent-management-system-tms.html">talent decisions</a> and can more easily identify and utilize potential.</p>
  <p>HR technology can enable organizations to assess potential to make more informed and objective decision-making when it comes to talent management and development. Organizations that can understand and ignite the potential of their workforce will not only realize their business objectives, but also create a positive experience for all employees.</p>

  <p>With a renewed <a href="/topics/human-resources">HR</a> focus on enhancing the employee experience, automating processes, and integrating core systems, the company envisioned a workforce management environment with fewer manual tasks. The automation company also wanted to simplify the process of onboarding new employees, as its employee population had doubled in size since 2017.</p>

  </div>
  <p>When the time came to modernize its core HR and talent management systems to help it achieve these aims, ATS reached for next-generation HR technology in the cloud to support its ongoing growth. Investing in <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/solutions.html">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite</a> allowed ATS to consolidate core HR and talent management processes throughout the employee lifecycle on a single technology foundation. Another bonus for ATS is that the suite helps simplify integration with various third-party solutions and other leading solutions from SAP, including <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana.html">SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition</a> and <a href="https://www.concur.com/">SAP Concur solutions</a> for use in expense management.</p>
  <p>With the adoption of the SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central solution to help centralize access to employee information, the company streamlined the addition of new employees into its organization following mergers and acquisitions. An integrated suite of SAP SuccessFactors solutions helps connect processes and data from recruiting to onboarding, compensation, learning, and performance and goals management. Mike Stone, director of Global ERP and HR Information Systems at ATS, explains: “New employees gain access to the same benefits as existing employees from day one. They get access to the same learning and performance and goal management tools to support their personal and professional development. And it allows them to see what the organization offers and where they can go in terms of their career potential.”</p>
  <p>Before adopting SAP SuccessFactors solutions, ATS was reliant on manual, paper-based processes and there was no simple way to track HR metrics. Now, the company can track employee turnover and better understand why its people leave. It can also keep a close watch on the time to fill open positions.</p>

  </div>
  <p>As ATS has a highly trained and highly tenured workforce, including engineers and skilled tradespeople, it’s important for the company to define those skills and continue to grow its talent base in that area. The company also needs to understand which skill sets will be needed in the future and how to help its people learn those skills as needs change.</p>
  <p>“The next stage of our HR transformation is developing a skills matrix and understanding who’s got what skills and who’s looking to grow those skills, then enhancing that skills composition within the company so that we have succession planning,” Stone explains. “With retirements, we need to know how fast we can fill those positions to get new people in place early enough so there’s a robust knowledge transfer and we don’t lose that tribal knowledge we have within the organization. SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite helps us measure the important time-to-hire metric, meaning we can be confident hiring within a two-to-four-week cycle in North America. While in Europe, we know it’s a three-month cycle, which makes it a little more challenging.”</p>
  <p>As ATS retools for the future, data insights from SAP SuccessFactors solutions are helping avoid situations where the company loses expert knowledge held within its people. It is also partnering with universities to create programs that align students’ learning with its needs for relevant skills and knowledge.</p>
  <p>SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite provides the people management technology foundation supporting ATS’s employee experience and ongoing growth. With solutions for core HR, recruiting, onboarding, performance, compensation, learning, and succession, ATS has the tools needed to build a future-ready workforce today.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>People managers have the potential to make or break the employee experience at an organization. They are responsible for understanding the demands of the business and motivating their team members to meet those requirements. However, the people manager role is evolving due to three crucial factors – hybrid and remote work, automation, and elevated employee expectations.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To help understand this evolution of the people manager role, the <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/successfactors/growth-insights-research/growth-insights-team">Growth &#x26; Insights team</a> for SAP SuccessFactors hosted interviews with 31 HR leaders from SAP customer organizations and conducted a survey of 731 people managers and 716 individual contributors from around the globe. Based on the research findings, below are six ways organizations can improve current people managers’ performance and experience with SAP SuccessFactors solutions.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="utilize-co-leadership-models">Utilize Co-Leadership Models</h2>
  <p>Organizations look to people managers to execute important initiatives and people practices, leading to an overload of responsibilities. Implementing co-leadership structures, even for a short period of time, can reduce a people manager’s role overload and provide individual contributors with a valuable experiential learning opportunity.</p>
  <p>One way to provide an experiential opportunity is through <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/05/bc7c3ca3-727e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">dynamic teams</a>, advanced capabilities available as part of SAP SuccessFactors solutions that can help create and manage cross-functional teams that exist beyond traditional hierarchies. <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/05/bc7c3ca3-727e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Statistics</a> reported that 66% of employees who had participated in a dynamic team felt a positive impact on their career, leading to higher engagement. Using dynamic teams can help organizations utilize co-leadership models for projects while also accessing individual contributor potential and incorporating those insights into future succession plans.</p>
  <h2 id="update-people-manager-job-descriptions">Update People Manager Job Descriptions</h2>
  <p>Many organizations have not updated their formal job descriptions for people managers to accurately reflect changes to their roles, leading to unclear performance expectations and ineffective systems for developing and selecting people managers. One way organizations can streamline this process is through <a href="/2023/10/new-sap-successfactors-ai-innovations-successconnect">generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting solution</a>. Hiring managers and recruiters can fine-tune job descriptions with generative AI, which allows them to incorporate supplementary content, identify biased language, and help ensure alignment with business requirements. Instead of starting from scratch every time a new position is created or requirements are updated, recruiters and hiring managers can use AI to help draft job descriptions faster and stay in their normal flow of work. And more importantly, the final content is more meaningful, inclusive, and competitive – presenting a clear and accurate view of the role to attract a larger pool of qualified and interested candidates.</p>
  <h2 id="rethink-career-architecture-and-pathways-to-advancement">Rethink Career Architecture and Pathways to Advancement</h2>
  <p>Without other options for growing, gaining status, or increasing compensation, employees will seek people management roles even if they are not suitable for or interested in this type of role. Developing alternative pathways for advancement, such as specialist career paths, for high-performing individual contributors ensures that employees are entering people manager roles for the right reason – to manage people.</p>
  <p>Sharing career architectures more broadly can also improve managers’ awareness of internal mobility opportunities, which they cited as a top challenge. Talent marketplaces, like the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/opportunity-marketplace.html">SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace</a> solution, can improve visibility into development and growth opportunities within the organization. It can provide AI-driven personalized recommendations for learning, mentors, internal roles, and dynamic teams. This allows employees to have experiential learning opportunities and can provide them alternate career paths.</p>

  </div>
  <h2 id="implement-succession-planning-for-all">Implement Succession Planning for All</h2>
  <p>Everyone agrees that people manager roles should become more exclusive, but that also means talent pools will become shallower. Implementing succession planning at all levels of the organization allows organizations to identify “hidden” people manager talent. When developing succession plans, consider that a people manager does not always need to be replaced with an existing people manager – and that a people manager’s next role does not always need to be in management. The <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/succession-development.html">SAP SuccessFactors Succession &#x26; Development</a> solution can make this process easier by helping employees expand their skills and advance their careers with visibility into continuous development dialogue, mentoring opportunities, and AI-powered career planning. It can also optimize succession planning, making it scalable to place the right people in the right roles and helping to secure the “hidden” people manager talent.</p>
  <h2 id="create-a-community-for-people-managers">Create a Community for People Managers</h2>
  <p>People managers consider staying engaged, feeling included, and managing their well-being to be top challenges. Creating a people manager community provides this crucial workforce segment with social support, which research has shown to be a positive driver of the people manger experience. This also offers the organization a clear channel to host two-way communication with people managers. One way to foster a community for people managers is to leverage the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/workzone-hr.html">SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone</a> solution, which is a personalized digital workspace that helps support and encourage collaboration. People managers can create their own community and connect with each other, allowing for more engagement, sharing of best practices, and improvement in the overall employee experience.</p>
  <h2 id="leverage-technology">Leverage Technology</h2>
  <p><a href="/topics/human-resources">Cloud HR technology</a> can help support the strategies recommended here and solve many of managers’ most pressing challenges. With SAP SuccessFactors solutions, organizations can put their people at the center of everything and create AI-powered experiences that can support current people managers while using talent intelligence to help uncover and develop the managers of tomorrow.</p>
  <p>As the expectations of people managers from both employees and organizations undergo constant evolution, the role of people manager will increasingly become more “people-centric” – focusing on support, fostering development, and nurturing a positive culture. It’s important that organizations use the right HR technology to deliver engaging employee experiences, increase productivity, and drive better business outcomes.</p>

    <div>
      <div>Over 50.5 million employees in the U.S. left their jobs in 2022 and each month more than 4 million people quit their jobs due to negative experiences at work. At the same time, employee tenure is rapidly declining, now at 4.2 years, down from 15.* All of these realities reinforce why employee experience matters. Employees today have an abundance of choice when it comes to work. In fact, most organizations would agree that what started as a trend is now a business imperative.</div>

  <p><a href="/topics/employee-experience">Employee experience</a> is linked to a number of organizational outcomes, such as performance, customer satisfaction, retention, and innovation. So, what are the trends redefining how employees think about work and how organizations meet the needs of their people to help them be their best? From the candidate experience to remote work to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&#x26;I), how can HR leaders gather the right data at scale, understand how employees feel, identify experience gaps, and take the right steps to drive positive work experiences that drive real business impact?</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.sap.com/cmp/dg/hr-meta-trends-2023/index.html?resource=%2Fcontent%2Fsapdx%2Fcountries%2Fen_us%2Fcmp%2Fdg%2Fhr-meta-trends-2023%2Ftyp.html&#x26;j_reason=unknown&#x26;j_reason_code=unknown?campaigncode=CRM-YI23-HXM-2055448&#x26;source=text-glo-SAPNews">2023 HR Meta-Trends Report</a>, published by the SAP SuccessFactors research team, shows that there has been a clear focus on improving the employee experience in order to drive organizational outcomes. HR trends are both influenced by and influential on how employees feel, making employee experience a fundamental principle. And it all starts with listening to employees, understanding where the experience gaps are, and identifying the best actions to address the issues.</p>
  <h2 id="navigating-modern-work-challenges">Navigating Modern Work Challenges</h2>
  <p>The results of Qualtrics research** show that employees have many wants and expectations for the future of work and organizations need to listen and pay closer attention to these five trends to enhance the overall employee experience and retain and attract top talent.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Employment is not only about having a job anymore.</strong> Employees want more than just a job. They want to work for organizations that have a sense of purpose and have values aligned with theirs. The more employees feel their employers embody these values, the more they are engaged and want to stay.</li>
    <li><strong>Confidence and business success also matter to employees.</strong> As markets become more volatile, employees want to feel confident in their jobs. They want to know that the organization is taking care of their needs so they have a sense of security, even during times of change.</li>
    <li><strong>Employees want a better work-life balance.</strong> People have been operating at surge levels for years and are reclaiming boundaries for a better work-life balance. Employees with a good work-life balance are willing to go above and beyond for their organization.</li>
    <li><strong>Flawed processes and inefficient systems have fueled burnout.</strong> Ineffective processes and systems remain the top driver for burnout. Giving employees the tools and technology to do their jobs effectively and efficiently helps increase productivity and engagement.</li>
    <li><strong>Growth and development are fundamental needs.</strong> Opportunities for growth and career progression drive employee retention, well-being, inclusion, and experience expectation levels. Understanding employee skills and providing opportunities for personalized development and growth through job matching, career development, mentorship, and community building are key to meeting employees‘ short- and long-term needs.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="addressing-trends-by-closing-experience-gaps">Addressing Trends by Closing Experience Gaps</h2>
  <p>Technology plays a crucial role in enabling organizations to understand what drives workforce productivity by facilitating continuous listening. <strong>SAP employee experience management solutions by Qualtrics</strong> help organizations listen to their people’s needs and take the right steps to close employee experience gaps.

    <div>
      <div>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the technology trend of 2023, and there really isn’t any competition for that title. As I speak to customers, they are eager to discuss AI, both because of their excitement but also their questions about how they can leverage AI responsibly in their organizations.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>With SAP Business AI, SAP is laser-focused on how we deliver AI that is relevant, reliable, and responsible.

    <li>With Joule, employees can experience a game-changing, conversational AI that draws from a wealth of business data across your organization. Imagine your most knowledgeable colleague, available anytime.</li>
    <li>Finally, generative AI in this release is focused on helping recruiters create job descriptions – an example of a discrete task that can eat away at productivity when performed manually at scale – as well as be prompted with AI-generated interview questions based on job descriptions in Microsoft Teams. You can expect more of these kinds of use cases to support secondary tasks in every release.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>AI is just one area we’re innovating in. Across our product vision areas, we’re delivering faster than ever on helping organizations build future-ready workforces, create elevated experiences for their employees, and maintain and enhance an agile and compliant HR. From the Horizon visual theme to a new integrated learning experience to integrations in Microsoft Teams that meet people in the flow of work to harmonization with the cross-system workflow, this release is packed with new and exciting capabilities.</p>
  <p>Read on – then check out our preview release – and learn how our latest release can help ignite the potential in your workforce today.</p>

  <p>When organizations understand the skills they have today and the skills they need for the future, they can develop organization-wide talent development strategies. At the same time, talent intelligence enables highly individualized, employee-led talent development that gives employees highly meaningful and rewarding careers, but also drives organizations to where they need to go.</p>
  <p>AI will drive the creation of skills information, as each employee will see skills inferences in their growth portfolios that suggest the skills they may already have using data from SAP SuccessFactors Performance &#x26; Goals. This can simplify the process for employees and helps ensure higher quality skills data across the organization.</p>
  <p>With this release, the talent intelligence hub can drive individualized recommendations for employees both in the new integrated learning experience as well as in SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace. But this is just the beginning, and you will see many more use cases for the talent intelligence hub across the entire suite in 2024.</p>

  <h3 id="horizon-visual-theme">Horizon Visual Theme</h3>
  <p>With this release, we have completed the rollout of the Horizon visual theme to all employee-facing pages. This modern, elegant user interface brings consistency across the entire SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite and will be available for every SAP cloud application by the end of 2024.</p>
  <h3 id="hr-in-the-flow-of-work-microsoft-teams-app">HR in the Flow of Work: Microsoft Teams App</h3>
  <p>With the SAP SuccessFactors app for Microsoft Teams, now available on the Microsoft Teams app store, we are bringing high-value, actionable HR processes directly into the flow of work. In this release, common self-service tasks, such as clocking in and out, updating location, or viewing a pay statement, can be completed directly from Microsoft Teams, helping to reduce the need to switch between multiple applications.</p>
  <h3 id="enhancements-to-sap-successfactors-employee-central">Enhancements to SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central</h3>
  <p>We are excited to introduce SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central quick actions, which can streamline manager and employee self-service. From the home page, employees can quickly complete common HR tasks, such as updating their chosen name and personal pronouns, while managers can initiate a transfer, promotion, location change, and more. These quick actions are also available in Microsoft Teams, SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone, and Joule, so users can complete critical HR tasks directly within the applications they are already using.</p>

  <p>The cross-system workflow capability is now generally available, which is designed to harmonize data and processes across platforms in a hybrid landscape, enabling increased productivity and reduced cost. This can empower customers using SAP ERP Human Capital Management on premise to more rapidly unlock the value of HXM with SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central while maintaining on-premise applications like time, payroll, and benefits – as needed – so they can progressively make their move to the cloud.</p>

  <h3 id="time-management">Time Management</h3>
  <p>We are introducing the ability for administrators to leverage employee time data to generate leave-related forms and documents, which can be e-mailed or downloaded in multiple formats. We have also enhanced the absence-counting rules framework to allow absences to be deducted based on different day types and conditions, helping to support unique legal and local regulations.</p>
  <p>We are also introducing new capabilities for auto-submission and mass approval of time sheets, helping ensure time information is available and processed in advance of a payroll run. To further enhance the time sheet experience, customers can now leverage a new business rule to display specific time types to relevant employees based on defined conditions. In addition, role-based time sheet alerts can now notify only the most relevant stakeholders. For example, late arrival or excessive overtime alerts can be sent to only the manager so they can address the situation separately with the employee. Administrators now have more flexibility to valuate time over longer periods, such as by quarter or year.</p>
  <p>Each of these innovations reinforces how we are continuing to deliver on our human experience management vision – putting people at the center of every organization. These innovations will be available in production during the weekend of November 17. Select capabilities will be in preview today.</p>

  <p>Connecting people in the moments that matter is at the heart of <a href="https://us.pandora.net/">Pandora</a>, the world’s largest jewelry brand. Based in Copenhagen, Denmark, Pandora employs 32,000 people worldwide. With 6,500 points of sale, including 2,500 concept stores, Pandora depends on the experience of its brick-and-mortar stores, which account for the majority of its sales.</p>
  <p>Three years ago, Pandora began its transformation from an analog retailer to a future-ready organization. It set out to strengthen and harmonize the global HR system landscape with an implementation of SAP SuccessFactors solutions to gain efficiency in how the company hires, manages, and develops employees worldwide, thus replacing a multitude of local applications.</p>
  <p>“We used the SAP SuccessFactors portfolio as a driver of transformation,” said Mihael Šutalo, vice president of People Technology, Pandora. “This is transforming the experience. The future integration of SAP S/4HANA Cloud with SAP SuccessFactors solutions will give us a tremendous opportunity to manage our workforce and manage our revenue model in a completely different way.”</p>
  <h2 id="bt-group-connects-people-for-good">BT Group Connects People for Good</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.bt.com/about">BT Group</a>, the world’s oldest telecommunications company, recently modernized its HR information systems to provide a digital colleague experience for its 100,000 employees working in 44 countries. “In 2021, we started what we call our I-Connect program,” said Elaine Bergin, director of Colleague Experience and Delivery, BT Group. The program name highlights BT Group’s purpose: “We connect for good.”</p>
  <p>The new colleague experience, launched in 2022, now uses the SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central solution, reporting and analytics, and the full suite of talent and learning management solutions to support the organization’s big focus on skills. BT Group also uses SAP SuccessFactors and SAP Fieldglass solutions to manage a contingent workforce of 60,000 additional employees.</p>

  <p>Greg Williams, director of Human Resources Information Systems, Brightspeed, summarized the value of an integrated approach for the organization: “Finance is up and running on SAP S/4HANA and with SAP Fieldglass solutions. We import that data into SAP SuccessFactors Learning, so our contractors can train on compliance and technical training. The SAP S/4HANA data is integrated into <a href="https://api.sap.com/package/SuccessFactorsEmployeeCentralwithThirdPartyTimeVendorWorkForceSoftwareWFS/overview">WFS</a>, which is our time system. We capture millions of dollars of project costs. Those are sent back to SAP S/4HANA on a pay-for-period basis.”</p>
  <h2 id="versuni-gains-agility-with-hxm-and-connected-cloud-erp">Versuni Gains Agility with HXM and Connected Cloud ERP</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.versuni.com/">Versuni</a>, formerly known as Philipps Domestic Appliances, is a consumer products company with the purpose to help people turn their houses into homes.

To succeed in a dynamic, consumer marketplace, it had to adopt best-of-suite applications that power advanced, digital-first consumer goods organizations.</p>
  <p>By connecting SAP S/4HANA Cloud to SAP SuccessFactors solutions, Versuni has achieved three key benefits: a seamless user journey based on a single source of truth across the entire landscape; increased visibility achieved from the integration with other systems, especially finance; and improved reporting, which is leading to better decision-making.

  <p>As the pace of technological innovation continues to accelerate, organizations face an incredible opportunity to explore new ways to get work done – ways that take engagement and productivity to new heights for everyone at work. Special guest <a href="https://go3.events.sap.com/successconnect/virtual/2023/reg/flow/sap/sc23/catalog/page/catalog/session/1695684941523001eAp3">Josh Bersin</a>, global industry analyst and CEO of The Josh Bersin Company, discussed the urgent need for companies to get on board with AI, emphasizing how AI can help keep companies ahead of the curve by transforming the employee experience. Bersin also shared ways to increase everyone’s knowledge and confidence when it comes to adopting AI, as well as the real economic benefits organizations can achieve based on early case studies.</p>
  <p>In addition, Julia White, member of the Executive Board of SAP SE and chief marketing and solutions officer, shared what AI means for businesses today and <a href="https://go3.events.sap.com/successconnect/virtual/2023/reg/flow/sap/sc23/catalog/page/catalog/session/1695684941478001eFQ4">how SAP is embedding AI into its cloud HR solutions</a>. She talked about the latest addition to SAP Business AI, <a href="/2023/09/joule-new-generative-ai-assistant">Joule</a> – a natural-language, generative AI copilot designed to help improve the experiences of everyone at work by making it easy for users to find information, get answers to questions, navigate processes, and complete tasks related to HR as well as finance, supply chain, and customer relationship management. She emphasized how Joule, with its AI-powered insight and assistance, can help organizations unlock new levels of performance, productivity, and efficiency.</p>
  <h2 id="talent-intelligence-is-key-to-closing-skills-gaps">Talent Intelligence Is Key to Closing Skills Gaps</h2>
  <p>The power of talent intelligence has far-reaching implications for how organizations can more accurately and efficiently evaluate talent across all levels and address skills gaps. During the event, there was a lot of buzz around the general availability of the <a href="/2023/10/skills-based-organization-talent-intelligence-hub">talent intelligence hub</a>, an AI-powered skills framework that’s built into the foundation of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/solutions.html?campaigncode=CRM-YI23-HXM-2055448&#x26;source=text-glo-SAPNews">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite</a>. Now organizations can have the power and simplicity of a single skills model to fuel everything from recruiting and onboarding to learning and development, as well as performance and succession.</p>
  <p>Sam Passman, vice president, Product Management at SAP SuccessFactors, provided a comprehensive overview of the <a href="https://go3.events.sap.com/successconnect/virtual/2023/reg/flow/sap/sc23/catalog/page/catalog/session/1695684941379001elme">talent intelligence hub</a>, including how organizations can better understand and leverage the skills of their workforce. “An organization that is not focused on skills is going to be left behind,” he said. “Customers often struggle with having visibility into their full skills picture and having employee profile data integrated throughout talent management processes. The talent intelligence hub is how we are making sure our customers can match the right people, doing the right work, at the right time – truly helping them become skills-based organizations.”</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>The intense competition for skills is compelling organizations to modernize their talent strategy. A future-ready workforce needs new skills and faster adaptability to keep pace with innovation and thrive in a rapidly changing world. HR leaders – as the organization’s champions of people development and culture – are at the forefront of a revolution in employee learning, growth, and skill development. That revolution is being driven by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI).</div>
    </div>

  <p>AI will truly inspire and transform the way people work and how organizations unlock individual and collective potential.</p>

  <p>To advance this transformation, SAP <a href="/2023/10/new-ai-sap-successfactors-capabilities-ignite-potential">announced new capabilities</a> at its SuccessConnect event that harness the power of AI to help organizations address the skills gap and ignite the potential within their workforces. These capabilities are embedded across the entire <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm.html?campaigncode=CRM-YI23-HXM-2055448&#x26;source=text-glo-SAPNews">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite</a> to help elevate the employee experience and guide every people decision, from talent recruitment and internal mobility to learning and performance management.</p>
  <p>“The richest source of potential in your organization is your workforce, all that they are today and all that they can be in the future,” said Aaron Green, SAP SuccessFactors chief marketing and solutions officer, speaking to the global HR community at SuccessConnect, held last week in Las Vegas, Nevada. “This is an opportunity for us to embrace AI to augment the way that people work and that’s how we ignite their potential. This allows us to maximize the skills within our workforces.”</p>
  <h2 id="putting-people-at-the-center-of-business">Putting People at the Center of Business</h2>
  <p>Human experience management, an HR software category pioneered by SAP SuccessFactors, puts people at the center of business with tools and technologies that help improve the employee experience and drive business results.</p>
  <p>The SAP SuccessFactors 2H 2023 release will include the general availability of new AI capabilities that can ignite potential in the workforce by raising employee productivity, increasing efficiency, and opening opportunities for growth and development. <a href="/2023/09/joule-new-generative-ai-assistant">Joule</a>, recently announced by SAP, is a natural-language, generative AI copilot that can truly understand business. Joule helps make it easier and faster for employees to navigate complex processes and for HR teams to respond to requests. In addition, new generative AI use cases help HR teams to elevate talent, recruiting, and learning.</p>
  <p>SAP SuccessFactors solutions are part of the overall SAP portfolio, one of the broadest suites of business applications available, all powered by SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). The latest innovations in SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite are powered by <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence.html?campaigncode=CRM-YI23-HXM-2055448&#x26;source=text-glo-SAPNews">SAP Business AI</a> to be relevant, reliable, and responsible.

  <p>“We are in a phase of rapid acceleration of AI,” said Green, who described how new AI use cases “will drive an outright transformation of two core facets of every organization: the way that people experience work and the way that we can unlock that individual and collective capability. That’s why we’ve delivered SAP Business AI that is truly built for business.”</p>

  <h2 id="talent-intelligence-hub-the-engine-of-a-skills-based-organization">Talent Intelligence Hub: The Engine of a Skills-Based Organization</h2>
  <p>Skills-based organizations, where skills take precedence over roles and titles, benefit through improved business agility and employee experience. The key to building a skills-based organization is the ability to accurately assess the current skills and capabilities of the entire workforce, identify skills that are needed for the future, and implement a learning and talent strategy that can effectively address the gaps.</p>
  <p>As the engine of a modern, skills-based organization, the <a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2023/04/c6c01178-6b7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">talent intelligence hub</a> is an AI-powered skills framework built into SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite that can drive an organization’s entire learning and talent strategy. Customers can benefit from having a single skills model that covers recruiting, onboarding, learning and development, performance, and succession. With a holistic view of the workforce based on skills data from multiple locations, they can make data-driven talent decisions and can more easily identify the right candidates for jobs.</p>

      </div>

  </div>
  <p>Employees are empowered to take charge of their careers by guiding their own career development. The talent intelligence hub allows them to build and manage an individual growth portfolio, which includes their skills, competencies, aspirations, motivations, and work styles. Based on this data, they can receive personalized talent development recommendations, which can include assignments available on <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/opportunity-marketplace.html?campaigncode=CRM-YI23-HXM-2055448&#x26;source=text-glo-SAPNews">SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace</a>, mentors, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2022-04-81143-dynamic-teams/index.html?campaigncode=CRM-YI23-HXM-2055448&#x26;source=text-glo-SAPNews">dynamic teams</a>. The talent intelligence hub is now generally available.</p>
  <p>“AI has arrived just at the right period of time to give us this productivity boost we need to grow,” Josh Bersin, industry analyst, shared in the keynote. “So, if you have an old-style management leadership team that says hire, hire, hire, hire…that’s not going to work anymore. It’s going to be automate, improve, redesign, reorganize – and that’s why these embedded AI tools like SAP SuccessFactors produce will be essential to your company’s growth.”</p>
  <h2 id="delta-air-lines-skills-development-advances-business-strategy">Delta Air Lines: Skills Development Advances Business Strategy</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.delta.com/">Delta Air Lines</a> is one company that is evolving to become a skills-based organization. An early adopter of the talent intelligence hub in SAP SuccessFactors solutions, Delta is building an employee experience focused on skills development and continuous learning that supports its business strategy. Employees will be able to maintain their own individual growth portfolios of skills and competencies and receive personalized learning recommendations for their skill development and career growth.</p>
  <p>“Delivering an elevated employee experience is important to us,” said Tim Gregory, managing director of HR Innovation and Workforce Technology at Delta. “We want a winning workforce and that means being able to attract the best and brightest from everywhere. We need to be able to see this talent through a skills lens. Our people work hard to develop and hone their skills. It’s personal, and when Delta is able to go beyond the traditional lens of job hierarchies and org charts, we create the elevated experience that attracts and retains the best talent.”</p>
  <p>Through its skills-first talent strategy, Delta eliminated degree requirements for more than 90% of non-executive roles in an aim to close the opportunity gap for talented employees who have been skilled through alternative pathways – emphasizing the retention and advancement of internal talent based on skills, competencies, and experience as a key driver of career mobility.</p>
  <p>Delta has set a long-term goal of filling 25% of its corporate and management openings with current talent that is in customer-facing roles. An internal review of job descriptions revealed that many jobs required a college degree. Gregory said, “We asked ourselves, do we care more about where their skills came from or if they have skills, are proficient in skills, are excelling in skills?”</p>
  <p>Eliminating unnecessary degree requirements has enabled Delta to move ahead in its goal of advancing more frontline employees with customer experience into its managerial ranks, which has benefits for its business strategy and customer focus.</p>
  <p>This is just one example of how Delta uses the talent intelligence hub to drive individualized talent development and put employees at the center of its transformation. Read more <a href="/2023/09/generative-ai-employee-experience-delta">here</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="the-power-of-the-talent-intelligence-hub">The Power of the Talent Intelligence Hub</h2>
  <p>The power of the talent intelligence hub was clearly shown during a demo on the main stage at SuccessConnect. Amy Wilson, senior vice president of Product and Design at SAP SuccessFactors, underscored the advantages of integrating talent intelligence within the SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite. “You will benefit from the simplicity and the power of a unified talent lifecycle – with a common language and a shared set of insights. And this extends beyond HXM to our entire SAP ecosystem,” she said, highlighting SAP S/4HANA, SAP Fieldglass solutions, and partner applications. “We are leveraging this rich data to dramatically improve the individual experience, from inferencing skills based on talent data to creating recommendations in the SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace to our <a href="/2023/09/new-integrated-learning-experience-sap-successfactors">brand-new learning experience</a>.”</p>

  <p>The demo followed the talent journey of Jada, a retail associate at fictitious Cookie Delight, who has big aspirations to participate in the product launch of a new line of cookies. AI-generated learning recommendations guide Jada as she builds out her skills profile to apply for an assignment on the product launch team.</p>
  <p>In SAP SuccessFactors Learning, Jada can see personalized learning recommendations matched to what she needs to learn to stay compliant, what she needs to learn to succeed in her current job, and what she wants to learn. After she completes a course, her skill level in her individualized growth portfolio is updated to “advanced.” In SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace, she finds an assignment to help with the new product launch and applies for the opportunity. “We’ve made it even better with this release,” said Wilson. “We’ve added top picks for you, which are recommendations based on your skills and interests. And now the opportunities find you.”</p>
  <h2 id="the-future-of-work-takes-off-with-ai">The Future of Work Takes Off with AI</h2>
  <p>SAP has been helping organizations run their business processes for 50 years. Siva Sundaresan, senior vice president of Applications Engineering at SAP SuccessFactors, provided a perspective for HR leaders on what the new AI capabilities will mean for the future of work.</p>
  <p>“At SAP, we are committed to implementing AI with ethics, privacy, and security at the forefront,” he said. “We have led the market in human experience and we are excited to help you embrace systems of intelligence. Talent intelligence is just the beginning. We will expand AI use cases across our portfolio. When you include HR, finance, supply chain, customer experience – that’s when you can truly transform the business.”</p>

  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Today, SAP announced the talent intelligence hub, an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered skills framework built into the foundation of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/solutions.html?campaigncode=CRM-YI23-HXM-2055448&#x26;source=text-glo-SAPNews">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite</a>, is generally available.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>As the future of work continues to evolve, organizations are tasked with building a dynamic and competitive workforce to stay ahead. Adopting a skills-based approach to talent management helps to identify, develop, and retain top talent. By shifting the focus from job titles and degrees to a comprehensive understanding of employees’ skills, businesses can have a more accurate and efficient evaluation of talent across all levels. This is where the power of the talent intelligence hub comes into play. With the right skills deployed to the right tasks, you can anticipate workforce changes and drive business agility and growth.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The talent intelligence hub can enable organizations to better understand, build, and leverage the skills of their workforces. It can connect individual skills, attributes, strengths, and preferences to both people and experiences throughout <a href="/topics/human-resources">SAP SuccessFactors solutions</a>. By having talent intelligence integrated in SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite, customers can have the power and simplicity of a single skills model from recruiting, onboarding, learning and development, all the way through to performance and succession.</p>
  <p>The talent intelligence hub makes it possible to build a skills-based organization by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Uniting skills and other data to create a holistic picture of your workforce</strong>: Understand the skills of your workforce with a portable, open framework that combines skills data from multiple sources to help support data-driven talent decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Making it easy for employees to build their individual skills portfolio</strong>: The growth portfolio provides skills recommendations that come directly from data within SAP SuccessFactors solutions as well as third-party skills data sources. Employees can describe themselves by including their aspirations, motivations, styles, and preferences. In addition, managers can use the team growth portfolio to help spot skills gaps quickly and assign skills for team members.</li>
    <li><strong>Finding the right candidates quickly</strong>: Get assistance with candidate screening through system-generated candidate evaluations based on the skills required for the job.</li>
    <li><strong>Enabling relevant learning and development</strong>: Surface personalized recommendations for upskilling based on skill gaps and roles employees aspire to have in the future. Intelligent recommendations include assignments, mentors, and dynamic teams to fuel ongoing growth.</li>
    <li><strong>Empowering employees to take charge of their career</strong>: Career development experiences are connected and driven by the growth portfolio, including career pathing and predictions based on skills intelligence.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Delta Air Lines, an early adopter of the talent intelligence hub, is building a dynamic, skills-based experience for continuous employee learning using the talent intelligence hub in <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/solutions.html?campaigncode=CRM-YI23-HXM-2055448&#x26;source=text-glo-SAPNews">SAP SuccessFactors solutions</a>. Individual employees have a growth portfolio, which is a profile that includes their current skills and competencies mapped to formal and informal learning opportunities within and outside the organization, including AI-powered recommendations.</p>
  <p>“We are incorporating disruptive technologies like our AI-driven skills ontology that automatically incorporates industry trends with embedded intelligence,” said Tim Gregory, managing director, HR Innovation and Workforce Technology, Delta Air Lines. “We can say which skills are most important to Delta Air Lines and the employee can easily combine those with their current capabilities, strengths and styles, and aspirations to create a personal career path. All of the content is based on Delta-specific skills and personalized to each employee’s career goals.”</p>
  <p>With the talent intelligence hub, organizations can gain a holistic view of their people, a necessary foundation for building a future-ready workforce.</p>

  <p>We are excited and honored by this news, as it recognizes our continued innovation and the impact it is delivering to our customers. With the extraordinary surge in innovation happening today, specifically around artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and analytics, it’s not only strategic for organizations to embrace these advancements, but it’s essential for ensuring their longevity and ability to compete. HR leaders are on the forefront of understanding where and how these technologies can be used to help their workforces become more productive and impactful – and truly ignite their potential.</p>
  <p>At SAP, we provide a comprehensive and global suite of cloud HR solutions. <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/solutions.html?campaigncode=CRM-YI23-HXM-2055430&#x26;source=text-glo-SAPNews">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite</a> spans core HR and payroll, talent management, HR analytics and workforce planning, and employee experience management.</p>

  <p>“Despite the more challenging economic climate, the cloud HR market has been very resilient and shows strong growth,” commented David Wilson, founder and CEO of Fosway Group. “For corporates, this is driving the need for comprehensive people strategies and a strong and connected HR ecosystem. SAP SuccessFactors has continued to be one of the leading drivers of this market at an enterprise level, both developing out new capabilities as well as improving customer performance and success.”</p>
  <p>Both multinational and midsize companies leverage SAP SuccessFactors solutions and our robust partner ecosystem to help modernize their HR functions, allowing them to remain agile and innovative. For example, customers like Versuni and Eurobank are using SAP SuccessFactors solutions to drive HR transformations that contribute to the overall business:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="/netherlands/2023/07/versuni-builds-platform-for-people-centric-organisation-with-sap-successfactors">Versuni</a></strong>, formerly known as Philips Domestic Appliances, recently unified its HR system in 52 countries with SAP SuccessFactors solutions, which has had far-reaching impact on the business. Jana Belyušová, CHRO at Versuni, recently said: “Our workforce planning is much more efficient. We can see much faster and more clearly for each country how the teams are composed and where needs lie. In addition, the number of information screens has been significantly reduced. That helps with finding the right information.”</li>
    <li><strong><a href="/2023/09/eurobank-labor-law-compliance-sap-successfactors-time-tracking">Eurobank</a></strong> has been able to deliver an inspiring employee experience and empower employees with tools to improve their daily work. With its people-first approach, Eurobank has achieved impressive milestones for employee engagement among its active SAP SuccessFactors solutions users, including more than 775,000 training hours logged and 13,000 performance assessment forms completed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Looking ahead, we are continuing to deliver new innovations for our customers so they can stay on the forefront of their industries. For example, <a href="/topics/ai">AI</a> is built directly into our solutions to help our customers understand the skills they have today, so they can plan what skills they will need in the future. We are also leveraging generative AI to transform the employee experience. Available next month, managers and recruiters can fine-tune job descriptions with generative AI – allowing them to create highly relevant descriptions and check them for bias, instead of starting from scratch every time a new position is created.</p>

    <div>
      <div>Every organization’s success is driven by its most valuable asset: its people. With <a href="http://sap.com/hr">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite</a>, we provide the technology, solutions, and best practices to help our customers future proof their workforce by putting people at the center of everything. Ensuring their workforce is set up for success means providing employees with an outstanding user experience (UX) that helps them get work done faster and easier.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>SAP SuccessFactors solutions help people be as productive as possible at work and can maximize the potential of any workforce. At the heart of our UX innovation strategy is a <a href="https://www.sap.com/design/stories-resources/designing-for-human-experience-management.html">deep understanding of user behaviors and priorities</a>. We have an in-house team of behavioral scientists who work in partnership with our product research team, design experts, and our customers. Together, they bring a unique – and proprietary – perspective to designing solutions based on how people behave and what they need to be productive at work.</p>

  </div>
  <p>That research has driven our recent major investments in UX. The past few years, the focus of our innovation has been to pair modern design elements with intelligent technologies, so people can quickly complete everyday tasks and feel more accomplished, supported, and engaged. This has created a new and wholly improved suite experience for our customers – and the work is only just beginning. The journey we’re on to deliver a people-centric user experience for our customers is realized through three key objectives: simplifying HR tasks, driving employee adoption and engagement, and delivering connected service experiences to meet the needs of today’s diverse and dispersed workforce.</p>
  <h2 id="simplifying-everyday-tasks">Simplifying Everyday Tasks</h2>
  <p>One overarching mission of ours is to simplify everyday HR tasks and increase productivity with high-impact, intuitive functionality. Continuous modernization with refreshed colors and information hierarchy creates a seamless, delightful user interface and enhanced accessibility that your workforce can confidently and efficiently navigate and interact with.</p>
  <p>And simplification extends even beyond our own solutions – a modern approach means we’re continuously embedding high-value, critical HR processes directly into partner applications that employees use frequently. We integrate SAP SuccessFactors solutions with other workplace technology solutions to help keep users productive, what we call meeting people in the flow of work. For example, integrations allow people to perform HR tasks within Microsoft Teams, including asking for and receiving feedback from their managers.</p>
  <p>All of which leads to the greatest evolution in UX we can expect in the coming years: <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence.html">business artificial intelligence (AI)</a>. SAP has the broadest suite of business applications on the planet, positioning us to be able to deliver the first true system of intelligence and fundamentally change the way in which companies operate. At SAP, we are embedding multiple types of AI – predictive, generative, and conversational, which are each uniquely targeted to improving experiences across the entire SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite, including talent acquisition, talent management, and core HR.</p>

  <p>We strive to create delightful and intuitive experiences that leave people with a sense of accomplishment and support. That means enabling inclusive experiences that empower all employees to operate in an application with meaningful content, functionality, and efficiency. This guides our design decisions and how we deliver innovative ways that address the unique requirements of each and every individual. Personalization is a must with today’s digital expectations, which is why we use data and insights to help anticipate and act on employee needs and expectations by empowering them with meaningful and individualized experiences.</p>
  <p>To that end, our modern Horizon visual theme for SAP Fiori helps provide a consistent UX. With intuitive experiences across the entire SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite, this helps to accelerate adoption of our software and accelerate learning curves. We delivered the Horizon visual theme to customers with our 1H 2023 release, and with the 2H 2023 release the vast majority of experiences in our products will be standardized in the Horizon visual theme.</p>
  <p>Another example of how we are improving engagement is with dynamic engagement cards in SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone, delivered earlier this year. These cards can deliver personalized, relevant, and timely news, announcements, and learning opportunities directly to employees’ SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone dashboards.</p>

        <p><em>A new learning home page surfaces personalized recommendations. Click to enlarge.</em></p>

  </div>
  <p>Of course, UX extends past the look and feel of our products and into overarching career experiences as well. The whole-self model, which takes into account each individual’s unique collection of interests, motivations, and preferences, forms the foundation for some of our most exciting capabilities and products, like <a href="/2022/08/supporting-working-in-dynamic-teams">dynamic teams</a>, SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace, and the talent intelligence hub. These can enable organizations to become skills-based and future-ready enterprises. For example, our new learning home page can surface learning recommendations to employees based on their interests, passions, and skills – so they can create a career and development path based on what’s best for them.</p>
  <h2 id="delivering-connected-hr-service-experiences">Delivering Connected HR Service Experiences</h2>
  <p>The third pillar driving our UX strategy is all about efficiency and improving service delivery for HR and beyond. Instead of forcing employees to guess where to find things with endless clicks and links or awaiting responses from a support specialist, employees can expect an experience that is intuitive, responsive, and connected across different services.</p>
  <p>With guided experiences within SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone, for example, HR leaders can create workflow-based, personalized journeys for employees that take them through a multi-step process possibly spanning multiple systems. This can make the onboarding journey, for example, frictionless and delightful for new workers – a critical time to make a good first impression. We are especially focused on the experience of deskless workers in 2024. Furthermore, our integrated knowledge base helps reduce HR tickets and can provide employees with quick answers, promoting the shared knowledge and fostering a more informed team.</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>In today’s turbulent business landscape, it’s no secret that leaders are facing mounting challenges and disruptions. The hybrid work era, the growing skills gap, and the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution are all drastically impacting how we think about work now and in the future. On top of this, global crises like climate change have put pressure on organizations to reevaluate policies and practices and establish new social contracts with their workers, supply chain partners, and communities.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Today, both employees and consumers hold organizations to higher standards. Just as consumers want to spend their money with companies they trust and believe in, employees want to earn theirs from an organization that aligns with their values. In fact, almost <a href="https://www.porternovelli.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02_Porter-Novelli-Tracker-Wave-X-Employee-Perspectives-on-Responsible-Leadership-During-Crisis.pdf">70%</a> of people report that they wouldn’t work for a company that doesn’t have a strong purpose.</p>
  <p>Business success is no longer measured by profit alone – instead, it’s defined by the impact an organization has on every part of its ecosystem. <a href="/2022/10/people-sustainability-investment-sap-research">People sustainability</a> – the intersection of employee engagement and corporate responsibility – is critical to building a future-ready workforce and requires an organization to consider the policies and experiences of people across their entire value chain. A comprehensive people sustainability strategy can help increase overall environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics, drive business outcomes, and build a better, brighter future.</p>

  <p><em>People</em> create new business models, lead critical initiatives, and effect change. With a people-first approach, organizations are more resilient, more capable, more innovative, and more motivated to deliver on sustainability goals.</p>
  <p>As the “people” experts, HR plays an important role in driving people sustainability. And with the right technology in place, it can start to take a more unified approach to people-centered initiatives. This looks like: tapping into new and diverse talent pools, empowering employees to learn and grow throughout the employee lifecycle, and creating a fair and equal workplace culture where everyone feels a sense of belonging. This not only benefits employees – it benefits business.</p>
  <p>Forward-thinking organizations like <a href="https://modpizza.com/">MOD Pizza</a> are already moving the needle on people sustainability. MOD’s mission goes far beyond serving delicious pizza – it believes that companies can and should be a force for good in their communities. “Our purpose is to create a place that includes everyone,” Dayna Eberhardt, chief people officer of MOD, tells SAP Chief Marketing &#x26; Solutions Officer Julia White in a recent interview for <a href="https://www.sap.com/sustainability/customer-stories.html#sustainability-challenge">The Sustainability Challenge: Building Breakthroughs to Zero</a>.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The key ingredient to MOD’s success is its people. MOD is not only committed to investing in its current employees through continuous learning, development, and career advancement, but it also strives to provide opportunities to those who typically face barriers to employment. This includes, for example, individuals who have formerly been incarcerated or have intellectual or developmental disabilities. Today, 99% of company-owned MOD stores have hired people with employment barriers. These hiring practices have led to a more engaged, empowered, and equitable workforce. “Our MOD Squad with barriers have a higher sense of belonging, a faster rate of promotion, and a higher retention rate,” Eberhardt says.</p>
  <p>Opening the door to opportunity is just the first step to workplace equity, which is why MOD makes the employee experience a top priority. When outdated HR processes were slowing down its recruiting and onboarding, MOD chose <a href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2023/07/623a5dca-807e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html?campaigncode=CRM-YI23-HXM-2055448&#x26;source=text-glo-SAPNews">SAP SuccessFactors solutions and SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition</a> to help redefine the value of HR data and processes, empowering the company to put its 10,000 – and growing – employees who make up the MOD Squad at the heart of its business.</p>
  <p>And this is a difference MOD’s customers can taste. “When we take care of our people, our people take care of our customers, and the business takes care of itself,” Eberhardt says.</p>
  <p>As we move into an uncertain future, companies like MOD that are actively prioritizing people, making positive impacts on the communities they serve, and taking real steps towards zero inequality will be best positioned to meet the business needs of today and tomorrow. And by putting people at the center of business – in purpose, culture, and technology – these organizations can create a more sustainable workforce and world.</p>

      <div>Rapidly evolving technology presents endless possibilities for enhancing the user experience (UX). SAP is seizing this moment to usher in a new era of efficiency, productivity, and engagement for businesses and their employees by integrating HR processes into the flow of work.</div>

  </div>
  <p>A prime example of this modern digital shift in UX is embedding high-value, critical HR tasks directly into the applications employees use daily. By integrating <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/solutions.html">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite</a> with other workplace technology solutions, SAP enables people to perform HR tasks without interrupting their daily work.</p>
  <p>All of us have seen how artificial intelligence (AI) can increase process efficiency and productivity, reduce human errors, and elevate user standards. But UX will change the most as the potential for new AI capabilities and models is expanded to address pressing business needs and employee expectations.</p>
  <h2 id="shaping-the-user-experience-with-a-purpose">Shaping the User Experience with a Purpose</h2>
  <p>Whether predictive, conversational, or generative, advancements in business AI are expected to bring the most significant shift in how people use technology at work.</p>
  <p>By investing in AI to strengthen SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite, SAP supports how people naturally interact, get work done, and leverage technology in the workplace. And best of all, we are doing it ethically by following our guiding principles to be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Helping users get greater insights and perform tasks more efficiently with AI designed with business context in mind to enhance the flow of work</li>
    <li><strong>Reliable:</strong> Using AI that is trained on the customer’s industry and company data and accessible in the solutions used each day</li>
    <li><strong>Responsible:</strong> Running responsible AI built on leading ethics and data privacy standards while maintaining full governance and lifecycle management across an entire organization</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By only employing AI technology that meets our stringent standards, we help our customers ensure the delivery of a meaningful and engaging UX for their entire workforce. Doing so allows employees to not only reach their full potential but also feel accomplished, supported, and engaged.</p>
  <p>For instance, HR professionals and their stakeholders are unlocking higher engagement and productivity for their employees, organizations, and businesses through their recruitment and talent development processes. One of the ways this is being accomplished is by unifying SAP SuccessFactors solutions with leading business productivity applications such as Microsoft Teams and further enhancing that integration with AI embedded in SAP SuccessFactors solutions to generate suggestions and recommendations using natural language.</p>
  <p>This business-oriented AI innovation represents some of the fundamental changes SAP is creating to transform how people will experience work in the years to come.</p>
  <h2 id="future-ready-hr-for-a-future-ready-workforce">Future-Ready HR for a Future-Ready Workforce</h2>
  <p>Our AI-enabled use cases for SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite are exceptional evidence of how HR tasks — from talent acquisition and talent management to core HR processes — can become a natural extension of people’s everyday work experience.</p>
  <p>Consider the value of these scenarios heavily used in the recruiting process:</p>
  <p><strong>Creating Job Descriptions</strong></p>
  <p>Hiring managers and recruiters can fine-tune job descriptions with generative AI within the SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting solution. This allows them to incorporate supplementary content, identify biased language, and help ensure alignment with business requirements. Once the final version is approved by the appropriate hiring manager and assigned recruiter, the job description can be published in SAP SuccessFactors solutions.</p>
  <p>Instead of starting from scratch every time a new position is created or requirements are updated, recruiters and hiring managers can draft job descriptions faster and stay in their normal flow of work. And more importantly, the final content is more meaningful, inclusive, and competitive — attracting a larger pool of qualified and interested candidates.</p>
  <p><strong>Interviewing Candidates</strong></p>
  <p>Hiring managers can construct unbiased and more effective interview questions by using AI-generated prompts, creating an exceptional impression on the candidate and leading to the right decision for both parties.</p>
  <p>Recruiters and hiring managers can also provide their assessment of candidates throughout the process through Microsoft Teams, which is then captured by SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting for further evaluation.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>For over 5,000 employees in <a href="https://www.eurobank.gr/en/group">Eurobank</a>, based in Athens, Greece, each working day begins with an important action to ensure the organization’s compliance with local labor legislation: they clock in on a personalized application powered by the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/employee-time-tracking-software.html">SAP SuccessFactors Time Tracking</a> solution.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Eurobank is one of Greece’s largest employers, numbering approximately 6,500 employees and one of the four leading banks in the country, with €81.5 billion in total assets under management and 500 office locations throughout Greece. In addition, it has 2,200 employees based at 120 sites in Luxembourg, Cyprus, Serbia, Bulgaria, and the UK.</p>
  <p>As a leading employer in Greece’s banking industry, Eurobank provides its employees with a simple, modern method to accurately track their working hours. This not only ensures that employees are paid correctly but also helps the bank comply with strict new laws that require all clocked hours to be transmitted in real time to the Greek Ministry of Labor.</p>
  <p>“We had to combine the strict legislation requirements along with a seamless and flexible work experience that we want to provide as an organization. We had to be very smart about this and we needed to do it fast,” says Maria Tachataki, head of People Engagement and Communications at Eurobank and leader of the SAP SuccessFactors solution implementation team. “We achieved this using SAP SuccessFactors Time Tracking in conjunction with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html?campaigncode=crm-ya22-int-1517065&#x26;source=ppc-de-google_ads-search-71700000112010169-58700008464075544-btp_btp-x-x-x&#x26;dfa=1&#x26;gad=1&#x26;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqdvovfqmgAMVl-x3Ch2aAAgGEAAYASAAEgI3ivD_BwE&#x26;gclsrc=aw.ds">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> (SAP BTP) in order to create that flexibility and achieve external connectivity.”</p>
  <h2 id="new-law-puts-labor-on-the-clock">New Law Puts Labor on the Clock</h2>
  <p>In 2021, the Greek government enacted labor law 4808/2021, which requires organizations with more than 250 employees to provide daily “live” monitoring of their employees’ work schedules, shift planning, and overtime. The introduction of a Digital Work Card means employers need to connect their time tracking system directly to the Ministry of Labor’s ERGANI II IT platform for real-time updates to ensure compliance with rules around the maximum weekly working time and minimum daily and weekly rest periods for employees.</p>

  <p>SAP SuccessFactors Time Tracking enables Eurobank to maintain compliance with the new regulation – especially important as penalties can exceed €10,000 per employee.</p>
  <p>“Compliance is a reality of modern business. Eurobank demonstrates its leadership in this area with an innovative approach for advanced and sophisticated employee time tracking,” comments Andreas Xirocostas, managing director, SAP Greece, Cyprus, and Malta. “As laws and regulations evolve, it’s increasingly important for companies to have accurate data to meet compliance requirements. Companies that have visibility into their employee data will be best positioned to adapt to new regulatory directives.”</p>
  <h2 id="unified-hxm-suite-for-a-live-and-interactive-experience">Unified HXM Suite for a Live and Interactive Experience</h2>
  <p>Since 2018, Eurobank has been using SAP SuccessFactors solutions as its core HRMS for all HR processes and talent management operations. The bank has recently also introduced SAP BTP as a solution for agility to help innovate and adapt to evolving business needs.</p>
  <p>Harnessing the power of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/solutions.html">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite</a> has enabled Eurobank to deliver an inspiring employee experience and empower employees with tools to improve their daily work. With its people-first approach, Eurobank has achieved impressive milestones for employee engagement among its active SAP SuccessFactors users, including more than 775,000 training hours logged and 13,000 performance assessment forms completed. By utilizing 124 interfaces or APIs, the SAP SuccessFactors portfolio can effectively integrate data with other Eurobank IT systems and applications.</p>
  <p>“It’s a very live and interactive experience for our employees, and time tracking with digital punch clocks is the cherry on top,” Tachataki says. “Since we had the entire suite of SAP SuccessFactors, implementing the time tracking solution was an obvious choice.”</p>
  <p><a href="/2020/07/eurobank-sap-successfactors-employee-engagement">Learn more</a> about how Eurobank puts people at the center of business with SAP SuccessFactors solutions.</p>
  <h2 id="prioritizing-data-accuracy-integration-and-employee-experience">Prioritizing Data Accuracy, Integration, and Employee Experience</h2>
  <p>Most importantly for Eurobank, the new time tracking solution needed to be reliable, accurate, and seamlessly integrated with other HR processes. The bank required a high level of data accuracy to comply with Greek law and perform payroll processing on a third-party system.</p>
  <p>“We are in the process of digitizing a lot of our workflows and a lot of our systems and services in the bank,” says Tachataki, who underscores the attention given to ensuring an employee experience that accommodates shift work, remote work, and preapproved overtime and flex time – in addition to providing seamless work schedule management and optimization. “We wanted to go to a modern platform where we could give both the employee and the manager the ability to manage their schedule much more efficiently and transparently.”</p>
  <p>The HR administrator’s experience also needed to be streamlined for efficiency and to reduce administrative burdens. “We wanted it to be simple,” Tachataki says. “We wanted to have reporting and analytics based on that to support decision-making processes.”</p>

  <h2 id="change-management-for-employees-enhances-success">Change Management for Employees Enhances Success</h2>
  <p>Eurobank went live with SAP SuccessFactors Time Tracking in January 2023, concluding a six-month project that included an intensive blueprint phase and near-daily interactions with the Ministry of Labor. Working within SAP BTP, the IT team customized an interface to the solution, so the data collection adhered precisely to the requirements of Greek law. Altogether, the team developed 28 interfaces to facilitate the data exchange with the ERGANI II system.</p>
  <p>Clear communication to the employees was an important contributing factor to the project’s success. “We provided a lot of training and support before we went live,” says Tachataki. “We went through a change management pathway with our employees to allow them time to adapt to this new reality. We continue to improve the module through the SAP upgrades and through our own intuitive creativity with the platform’s abilities.”</p>
  <p>When employees clock in or clock out in SAP SuccessFactors Time Tracking, they see a clean, simplified user interface that facilitates quick action. They have an overview of their schedule – including flex time, approved overtime, and estimated leave time.</p>
  <p>“The amazing results that Eurobank has achieved by using SAP SuccessFactors Time Tracking for compliance show why agility is the watchword in business today,” says Maryann Abbajay, chief revenue officer, SAP SuccessFactors. “When faced with new legal requirements, Eurobank reached into the SAP SuccessFactors tool kit and adapted a solution to meet compliance – and it did it while keeping employee experience in focus.”</p>
  <h2 id="truth-in-data">Truth in Data</h2>
  <p>As a result of providing an empowered employee experience through self-service, Eurobank logs over 5,000 clock-ins and clock-outs per day. SAP SuccessFactors Time Tracking supports the company to make 131,000 API calls to the Ministry of Labor’s ERGANI II system each month.</p>
  <p>Despite a high level of employee engagement, Eurobank is realistic that it is not possible to have 100% daily compliance among 6,500 employees, and some discrepancies have had to be clarified. Fortunately, this is an area where SAP SuccessFactors Time Tracking supports the organization with data accuracy and transparency. “The point is to have a managed inconsistency,” says Tachataki, who explains, “If there is an inconsistency, you need to be able to justify it so you don’t get fined and have a system that very accurately logs employees’ clock-ins and -outs and supports your case. SAP SuccessFactors can help us do this.”</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>More than ever, organizations worldwide are seeking to improve employee commutes and transportation with flexible and sustainable options – not only to bring employees back to the office, but to boost employee satisfaction and retention and gain a competitive edge in recruiting new talent.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The HR team at <a href="https://www.degroofpetercam.com/en-be">Bank Degroof Petercam</a> gladly accepted that challenge and raised it, aiming not only to alleviate commuting-associated stress but also to streamline HR processes while incentivizing sustainable transportation alternatives.</p>
  <h2 id="overhauling-employee-transportation-benefits">Overhauling Employee Transportation Benefits</h2>
  <p>With offices in major cities across Belgium and over a thousand employees grappling with a daily commute, Degroof Petercam realized that the bank’s employee transportation benefits needed a significant overhaul. Employees had to choose one mobility plan from limited options and commit to it for four years. The application process was also cumbersome, miring employees and HR staff in time-consuming, manual tasks.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">

        <h3 id="better-together-customer-conversations-with-bank-degroof-petercam">Better Together: Customer Conversations with Bank Degroof Petercam</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2023/09/b207b37f-8a7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Watch the video</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Degroof Petercam needed an intuitive, flexible application to maximize employee benefits and meet their commuting preferences while encouraging sustainable commuting and minimizing administrative headaches. The bank reached out to Flexso, whose deep HR business expertise and extensive experience with <a href="/topics/business-technology-platform">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> (SAP BTP) made it the perfect partner.</p>
  <p>Guy Spitaels, head of HR Service Center, Payroll &#x26; Systems, explained: “We started from a blank page, so it was really important to have a sounding board, and Flexso challenged us in each phase of the project…They really played a critical role.” As for the development process, Bert Van Bree, solution architect at Flexso Digital, said, “I think our approach can be summarized as start with design thinking and then scale with architecture thinking” while remembering that “the application must really empower the employee.”</p>
  <h2 id="meeting-the-personal-needs-of-employees-while-helping-the-planet">Meeting the Personal Needs of Employees While Helping the Planet</h2>
  <p>Flexso’s human-centric approach, combined with the power of SAP BTP, resulted in a new mobility app perfectly tailored for the employees and the business. The user-friendly app gives employees the flexibility to spend their yearly commuting budget on an array of options – public transportation, leasing a traditional or electric bike, leasing a gas-powered, hybrid, or electric car, or any combination of the above.</p>
  <p>For example, an employee might choose to drive on days when they are dropping a child off at school or heading straight to the gym after work and then take public transportation at other times. The app allows users to simulate infinite combinations of different transportation scenarios to create their ideal commute. Degroof Petercam employees value “the transparency and the flexibility of our tool,” Kira Zouboff, HR business analyst, said, and the simulations allow them to “play in the tool. They discover all of its features while they are making their own choices, meeting their personal needs.”</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To reduce the bank’s overall carbon footprint, the new app awards employees a “green bonus” when they choose more sustainable options, a benefit that has increased Degroof Petercam employees’ sustainable commutes by 50%. “We can incentivize the reduction of our carbon footprint while offering a very flexible solution, and the fact that the tool is consolidating all of the data helps us report on long-term sustainability solutions in line with all of the initiatives that are led by our group sustainability manager,” Zouboff explained.</p>
  <h2 id="efficiency-improvements-for-hr">Efficiency Improvements for HR</h2>
  <p>As for the HR team, the new mobility app automatically assigns each employee’s transportation budget and provides a real-time view of employee choices and requests through the user-friendly administrative platform. After the app’s rollout, Degroof Petercam saw a 75% improvement in efficiency around the administration of mobility benefits.</p>
  <p>The mobility app is also a powerful recruitment tool for like-minded top talent. “I think our large and flexible mobility offer is absolutely an asset in the war for talent,” Spitaels said.</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Representation of women in leadership has been increasing in recent years. However, only about 25% of C-suite leaders and 40% of manager-level positions are held by women today. According to psychologists, biased perceptions of women in the workplace may be partially to blame, preventing women from obtaining and being successful in leadership-level roles. The inability to access higher levels of leadership is termed the “broken rung,” and there is still a lot of work to do to repair it.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Recently, a group of psychologists at the annual Society for Industrial &#x26; Organizational Psychology conference met to present emerging research on the broken rung. Caitlynn Sendra, Ph.D., experience product scientist at SAP SuccessFactors, who hosted the session, explained that because of the roles men and women historically held in society, our stereotypes around men and women can carry over into today’s workplace, even if not intentionally. “Men are stereotypically thought to be agentic, direct, and task-focused – traits historically associated with leaders. On the other hand, women are stereotyped to be nurturing, communal, and community-focused,” explained Sendra. Although this has led women to be seen as less leader-like, Sendra presented original research on how this may actually give women leaders an advantage when it comes to influencing organizational culture.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Throughout the session, the researchers presented data on several different sources of potential bias around women leaders, including 360-degree reviews, “high-potential” programs, and feedback. For example, Dr. Martin Lanik, CEO of Pinsight, demonstrated that men are three times more likely than women to be identified as “high potential.” Additionally, Dr. Stefanie Mockler, co-founder of The Violet Group, showed data indicating that managers tended to “soften” their feedback to women. The message of the session was clear: businesses need to be proactive in removing this bias from people processes in order to level the playing field for women leaders.</p>
  <p>The session ended with a discussion about what <a href="/topics/human-resources">HR</a> leaders can do to help reduce bias towards women leaders. Providing training on bias awareness and reduction was one solution provided by the researchers. HR technology was also called out as a key piece of the puzzle.</p>
  <p>At SAP, we’re working with organizations of all sizes to help drive more equitable and inclusive HR strategies that empower equitable experiences for every employee, including women. With embedded features throughout <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm.html?campaigncode=CRM-YI23-HXM-2055448&#x26;source=text-glo-SAPNews">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite</a>, our customers are provided with the tools they need to help detect and prevent unconscious bias while also gaining the insights required to make decisions that can cultivate a diverse and inclusive workforce.</p>

      <div>Contemporary living at its finest is exemplified by a rich blend of technology, innovation, and design that delivers an unparalleled experience. In the modern home, for example, a new generation of domestic appliances makes cooking and cleaning easier and more enjoyable, bringing the benefits of comfort and convenience to what were once demanding daily household chores. These innovations in the home afford us precious time to spend with the people we love and improve our quality of life.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><a href="https://www.versuni.com/">Versuni</a>, formerly known as Philips Domestic Appliances, excels in its purpose to help people turn their houses into homes, so they can lead happier, healthier lives. Versuni is headquartered in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, with innovation, manufacturing, and commercial centers across the globe and a footprint in over 100 countries. With a global workforce of approximately 6,400 employees, Versuni advances a workplace culture of collaboration, empowered decision-making, and employee engagement supported by leading-edge HR.</p>
  <p>As its name suggests, Versuni – think “universe” – wants consumers to know that “our universe is the home” and specializes in domestic appliances that make routine tasks simple, enjoyable, and sustainable. Versuni has brands such as Philips, Saeco, Gaggia, Preethi, Philips Walita, L’OR Barista, and Senseo to cover cooking, coffee, garment care, floor care, and climate care.</p>
  <h2 id="digital-first-company-for-consumer-engagement">Digital-First Company for Consumer Engagement</h2>
  <p>Versuni took the unique opportunity of reinventing itself as an independent company to transform its entire technology landscape. To succeed in a dynamic, consumer marketplace, it had to evolve from best-of-breed solutions that served its healthcare parent company to best-of-suite applications that power advanced, digital-first consumer goods organizations.</p>
  <p>“Since we are in consumer products, we needed to be a digital-first, insight-led company to enable us to go for lifetime engagement with our consumers across our connected products,” says Lokesh Rastogi, IT platform leader for Finance and HR, Versuni.</p>

  <p>To establish a foundation for future growth, Versuni adopted an outside-in approach to harmonizing and simplifying all processes in a bid to achieve end-to-end transparency. The IT project was given a fitting name, “Exuviate,” to describe how the organization shed its old technology layer so it can transform into something new and distinctive as a consumer-focused enterprise.</p>
  <p>Versuni worked with <a href="https://www.tcs.com/">Tata Consulting Services (TCS)</a> to carry out an organization-wide, greenfield implementation by leveraging <a href="https://www.sap.com/intelligent-enterprise.html">SAP Intelligent Enterprise Framework</a> for processes, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform.html">SAP Business Technology Platform</a> (SAP BTP) for collaboration and integration, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/rise.html">RISE with SAP</a> for cost control. While firmly adhering to best practices, Versuni laid out a strategy guided by a crisp logic: “SAP unless…; cloud unless…; and best of suite.” Considered to be one of the largest RISE with SAP projects in any industry, the transformation was completed in a record 18 months, when Versuni transitioned to SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition in all countries.</p>
  <p>With the new SAP environment, Versuni reports 30% enhanced agility in its responsiveness, 85% improvement in standardization and harmonization, and 50% increased employee engagement. In recognition of its outstanding success, Versuni’s Exuviate project was chosen as an <a href="https://www.sap.com/idea-place/sap-innovation-awards/entries/2023-award/submission-details.html?idea_id=3644">SAP Innovation Award winner</a> in the Industry Leader in Consumer Products category. For more information, read the <a href="/uk/2023/05/versuni-realises-completely-new-technology-landscape-with-sap-and-tcs">press release</a> from SAP Sapphire Barcelona.</p>
  <h2 id="opportunity-for-a-new-hr">Opportunity for a New HR</h2>
  <p>The Exuviate project had set in motion the total transformation of Versuni’s IT landscape and established new business processes. The challenges facing Versuni’s HR department, however, were especially formidable: after the transition, there would be no way to manage and compensate Versuni’s workforce unless a new HRIT system was up and running globally. Relying on its legacy software was not an option.</p>
  <p>Versuni’s HR team chose <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm.html">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) solutions</a> to help maximize value and maintain a clean core, one of the priorities of the Exuviate project. The team doubled down on the opportunity to achieve a full-scale HR transformation that affected all underlying HR policies.</p>
  <p>“Due to the new setup of Versuni, we wanted to have a new HR policy for all countries, meaning we had a new organization structure to manage, new job family structure, new competencies for jobs, and a new salary structure,” says Amber Smeulders, business unit lead, HR Xperience expert at <a href="https://mccoy-partners.com/">McCoy</a> and hired by Versuni as program manager to manage the full HR digital transformation. “This was the biggest challenge in our program: it should be a happy marriage between managing a new HR policy together with following the design principles of best practice.”</p>
  <p>“The HR transition to SAP SuccessFactors solutions in itself was a massive task, so we ran the HR transformation as a separate pillar within the Exuviate transformation,” says Rastogi. This required Versuni to deploy SAP SuccessFactors solutions in less than one year.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“We did it in 10 months from design to deployment,” confirms Rastogi. On April 1, 2023, Versuni went live in 52 countries simultaneously with 15 modules of SAP SuccessFactors solutions, including <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/employee-central-hris.html">SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/workzone-hr.html">SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/corporate-lms.html">SAP SuccessFactors Learning</a>, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/talent-management.html">SAP SuccessFactors Talent Management</a>.</p>
  <p>“What Versuni accomplished in its HR transformation is nothing short of spectacular,” says Maryann Abbajay, chief revenue officer, SAP SuccessFactors. “Versuni translated a new set of business demands and way of working into SAP SuccessFactors solutions, really taking advantage of the connected cloud environment to gain visibility into its workforce and enable employee-centric HR. This is going to bring a new level of agility to Versuni that will set it on a path for long-term success.”</p>
  <p>Versuni worked closely with SAP to ensure it had access to the right resources and expertise. “We hired subject matter experts with SAP SuccessFactors knowledge, but also worked with the HR business to make sure that the design of SAP SuccessFactors solutions and the design of the HR policies were going hand in hand,” says Smeulders. With the right team in place and a clear governance structure, Versuni was able to complete the project in record time and fast track its time to value.</p>
  <h2 id="reporting-gains-strategic-value-in-connected-cloud-landscape">Reporting Gains Strategic Value in Connected Cloud Landscape</h2>
  <p>Although Versuni was satisfied with the operational reporting available in SAP SuccessFactors solutions, it also needed cross-organizational reporting that leveraged data available in the connected SAP landscape. Therefore, Versuni and SAP created a solution for its management reporting. “We tried it out in HR as a proof of concept,” says Rastogi. “It was highly successful and now we intend to roll it out across the organization. It brings quite some benefits in terms of insights into our HR data.”</p>
  <p>Smeulders agrees and looks forward to strategic insights from SAP SuccessFactors with the connected environment. “We would like to combine the HR data with data coming from the other SAP systems to really understand what is best for us when we talk about investment in positions, in HR policies, and in the right talents,” she says.</p>
  <h2 id="complete-transformation-in-record-time">Complete Transformation in Record Time</h2>
  <p>By connecting cloud enterprise resource planning (ERP) to SAP SuccessFactors solutions, Versuni has achieved three key benefits. It now has a seamless user journey based on a single source of truth across the entire landscape. Another benefit is the increased visibility achieved from the integration with other systems, especially finance. Also, improved reporting is leading to better decision-making. Rastogi summarizes: “It’s one source of truth, one system, and one number.”</p>
  <p>Enhanced employee experience is among the additional benefits of the HR transformation. Payroll consolidation resulted in a reduction of more than 20 providers into one global provider. Versuni lowered costs with a 70% reduction of local applications. Localization for time and attendance is now supported. Nearly all HR processes are now available on a mobile device.</p>
  <p>“We’re still on the journey,” says Rastogi. “What is very clear across the organization is a mind shift change, a culture change. We’re starting to see that it is much more collaborative and faster. The decision-making is empowered and much quicker. It’s been a complete transformation – digital transformation as well as business transformation – in record time.”</p>

  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>The competition for talent has shifted to the competition for skills. At a time where rapid change is the new normal, organizations are faced with skill shortages that hiring won’t solve. Understanding the skills you have and the skills you need is key to staying competitive in the future.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Also, the way we learn has transformed due to shifting employee expectations around technology and new work conditions. Balancing compliance and regulatory requirements while enhancing internal mobility, career growth, and the employee experience is now a business essential. <a href="/topics/training">Learning</a> must close skills gaps for personal development and align with strategic business needs in today’s marketplace.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/03/f8800771-677e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">HR meta-trends 2023 report</a> highlights upskilling and talent attraction as key. To predict business needs, organizations must plan and target skills gaps. They must also understand employees’ career goals and take their whole self into consideration for personalized development. This approach creates engaging experiences and aligns with what employees want.</p>
  <p>Learning drives transformation but breaking traditional silos challenges skill growth alignment. Many organizations have invested in learning experience platform solutions to increase learner engagement, but this approach alone has not solved the challenge of increasing skills growth across the organization while aligning learning to strategic business goals.</p>
  <h2 id="connected-learning-as-strategic-part-of-skills-growth">Connected Learning as Strategic Part of Skills Growth</h2>
  <p>The SAP SuccessFactors Learning solution is a key part of our broader future-ready workforce strategy to help align the ambitions of people and organizations for shared achievement of accelerated skills growth. Later this year, customers can expect an enhanced integrated learning experience for SAP SuccessFactors Learning.</p>
  <p>While this <a href="https://sapvideoa35699dc5.hana.ondemand.com/?entry_id=1_192xh5up">integrated learning experience</a> will include a redesigned, revitalized homepage, it will also help identify the many learning options available to employees – the items that people “have to learn,” such as mandatory learning for safety and compliance; those that they “need to learn” to excel in their roles and achieve business objectives; and what they “want to learn” based on their own interests, aspirations, and motivations.</p>

  <p>Here, the integrated learning experience will leverage the <a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_SUCCESSFACTORS_RELEASE_INFORMATION/8e0d540f96474717bbf18df51e54e522/fc935fe0114b49008e39916871c480d3.html?q=talent%20intelligence%20hub">talent intelligence hub</a> framework within the SAP SuccessFactors portfolio. The talent intelligence hub is a centralized framework that helps organizations understand the skills their employees have today, the gaps that exist, and the ways in which to close those gaps. With machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered intelligence, the talent intelligence hub can provide highly personalized learning and development recommendations to help ensure employees develop their skills sets while pursuing a career aligned to their ambitions. This accelerates upskilling and reskilling at scale while delivering unique talent experiences for every employee.</p>
  <p>This fresh take on corporate learning fosters an intrinsic culture of upskilling within the corporate landscape. Considering employees as a whole – with a data-driven view of their skills, wants, and needs – can drive workforce progress in an organic manner. That’s because a motivated and talented workforce contributes to a future-ready business strategy that employers can sculpt to meet the ever-changing demands of a fluctuating market.</p>
  <h2 id="four-ways-to-address-the-skills-gap-with-the-new-integrated-learning-experience">Four Ways to Address the Skills Gap with the New Integrated Learning Experience</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Prioritize learning opportunities that encourage collaboration, growth, discovery, and curiosity while ensuring employees stay compliant with business and legal objectives.</li>
    <li>Accelerate upskilling processes through greater visibility, access, and navigation through the integrated learning experience.</li>
    <li>Improve engagement through experiences that prioritize and organize a learner’s individual needs, skills, interests, and aspirations.</li>
    <li>Individualize opportunities and personalized recommendations for learning activities, mentors, temporary assignments, and more, fueling professional development through SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>All of this can allow organizations to curate the strategic attributes they expect in their people while also supporting their growth and development aspirations. Being on a skills transformation journey the integrated learning experience has already piqued the interest of organizations looking to support both their employees and their overall business strategies. Simon Wißmann, director of Corporate HR at Bertelsmann SE &#x26; Co. KGaA, believes “that the new integrated learning experience with its modern look brings added value to our employees by restructuring how mandatory trainings and trainings for personal growth are presented and added to the personal learning journey.” By integrating the new experience with its learning strategy, Wißmann is confident that “it will help to develop critical skills in our organization by closely linking together talent and learning processes while enabling employees to grow to their full potential.”</p>
  <p>This essential focus on employee experience in a more unified way can promote a culture of learning and growth in an organization’s landscape, which is essential for succinctly meeting critical business objectives. It is increasingly clear that when a company invests in accelerated upskilling solutions to create agile workforces that understand their individualized contributions to the organization’s overall strategy, it can reap extraordinary benefits.</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Flying people to their destination as promised is table stakes for what <a href="https://www.delta.com/">Delta Air Lines</a> calls the company’s “virtuous circle” between customers, employees, and shareholders.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Now the organization is expanding its strategy to create a digital virtuous circle founded on a simple principle: the only way to deliver a seamless, personalized customer experience is to do the same for employees. It’s designed to provide artificial intelligence (AI)-based training and career development at the precise intersection of customer expectations and employee skills and aspirations.</p>
  <p>“Using technology and empirical evidence, we can provide a positive, personalized employee experience that motivates people to deliver that little extra effort, going above and beyond for the benefit of our customers,” said Tim Gregory, managing director of HR Innovation and Workforce Technology at Delta Air Lines. “If you do well by your people, they will do well by customers. This is the cornerstone of our skills-based organization.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Speaking at this year’s <a href="https://www.sap.com/events/sapphire/orlando.html">SAP Sapphire &#x26; ASUG Annual Conference Orlando</a>, Gregory said that Delta Air Lines is developing a generative AI proof of concept slated to automatically transform generic skill descriptions into more accurate capabilities that reflect the job’s requirements based on real-world, updated employee and customer data in context.</p>
  <p>“We want to include the concept of intuitive reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) that allows the hiring manager to provide feedback to the machine, going beyond just fine-tuning,” he said. “That way, our employee’s time goes towards benefiting our customers and achieving our business goals.”</p>
  <p>Here are highlights from Gregory’s presentation where he shared how Delta Air Lines was investing in the company’s employee experience to the delight of customers and for the organization’s competitive advantage.</p>
  <h2 id="linking-cx-to-ex-generates-customer-centric-business-results">Linking CX to EX Generates Customer-Centric Business Results</h2>
  <p>According to Gregory, research found that skills-based organizations were 107% more likely to place talent effectively and 98% likelier to retain high-performing talent and have a reputation as a great place to grow and develop. It’s impossible to argue with the strong business results of Delta’s strategy that links the customer and employee experience. <a href="https://news.delta.com/delta-ranked-6th-best-employer-world-forbes">Forbes</a> ranked Delta the sixth best employer in the world. The airline is No.1 in on-time arrivals and a trusted consumer brand.</p>
  <p>Just as data reveals what matters to customers most, so does it surface insights to help Delta create a positive employee experience, whether someone was just hired or has ambitions to move up in the organization. For example, Delta has already exceeded one of its objectives to fill 25% of corporate and management positions with people who are currently in customer-facing roles.</p>
  <p>“Delta people are highly diverse with many kinds of backgrounds, educational levels, and capabilities,” said Gregory. “Bringing our frontline employees into management makes solid business sense because they have a customer-centric perspective that they’ll incorporate into their managerial role. That will enable us to have a strategic direction focused on our customers. These folks can leverage their existing knowledge so that the learning curve and time to productivity is lower than if we were to hire externally. It’s more cost-effective to move someone up through the organization, and it gives us a deep bench of talent for succession planning.”</p>
  <p>Gregory added that 90% of non-executive management roles at Delta Air Lines no longer require a college degree.</p>

  <p>To help employees move from an hourly, customer-facing role to the salaried corporate position of their dreams, Delta Air Lines is building a dynamic, skills-based experience for continuous employee learning using the talent intelligence hub in <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm.html">SAP SuccessFactors solutions</a>. Individual employees have a growth portfolio, which is a profile that includes their current skills and competencies mapped to formal and informal learning opportunities within and outside the organization, some recommended by AI-based algorithms.</p>
  <p>“We are incorporating disruptive technologies like our AI-driven skills ontology that automatically incorporates industry trends with embedded intelligence,” said Gregory. “We can say which skills are most important to Delta Air Lines and the employee can easily combine those with their current capabilities, strengths and styles, and aspirations to create a personal career path. All of the content is based on Delta-specific skills and personalized to each employee’s career goals.”</p>
  <h2 id="how-to-build-a-modern-skills-based-organization">How to Build a Modern, Skills-Based Organization</h2>
  <p>Centralizing employee profiles with opportunities to learn and collaborate on one intelligent platform provides Delta’s employees with development paths that reflect the organization’s business strategy.</p>
  <p>“We’ve taken our approach to customer experience and applied it to the employee experience, building a modern, skills-based organization,” said Gregory. “Our digital virtuous circle means that we invest in our employees, the employees invest in our customers, our customers invest in us by choosing Delta Air Lines, and our shareholders keep investing in us to keep the whole flywheel turning.”</p>

      <div>Today, businesses in nearly every industry face skill shortages that hiring alone won’t solve. In an era where rapid change is the norm, having the right skills today and building them for the future is key to closing the widening gap. In parallel, the rate of technological innovation continues to accelerate, forcing organizations to embrace new technologies, like artificial intelligence (AI), to achieve sustainable growth.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Moving forward, the most effective leaders will embrace the fast-moving market dynamics. They’ll invest in their people to help them acquire new skills and prioritize a culture that focuses on creating the best possible employee experience to ignite the potential of their workforce and business.</p>

  <p>Today’s hype around AI tools like ChatGPT inspires a future state for AI in the world. But business AI is all around us <strong>right now</strong>, playing a role in helping our customers’ <a href="/2023/05/future-proof-hr-operations-low-code-no-code-tech">businesses</a> become more agile. Right now, AI helps to power SAP’s cloud ERP, spend management, customer relationship management, and human capital management business processes. More than 24,000 SAP cloud customers can already use hundreds of built-in AI capabilities.</p>
  <p>AI growth means almost every industry needs people with AI skills at different levels and different depths. As one might expect, AI engineers, coding, and SAP <a href="https://developers.sap.com/">developer skills</a> are in demand. But there can be other opportunities to enter the field, depending on your interests. Here are five ideas to find your path to a first, second, or even third career in AI.</p>
  <p>Spoiler alert: Curiosity and an openness to learning are key!</p>
  <h2 id="first-find-your-starting-block">1. First, Find Your Starting Block</h2>
  <p>It’s okay to be a novice!</p>
  <p>Every path into the AI arena starts with a <a href="https://open.sap.com/courses/ai1">foundational understanding</a> of AI concepts, terminology, and applications. Become familiar with key terms like machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, natural language processing, and data analytics. Understand how AI can impact business processes and improve customers’, employees’, partners’, and suppliers’ experiences. Then, explore online resources, demos, <a href="https://developers.sap.com/tutorial-navigator.html">tutorials</a>, and introductory courses to understand basic AI principles. SAP’s AI <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/machine-learning">communities</a> are a great place to start learning in a peer-to-peer setting. Keep watching <a href="https://learning.sap.com/">SAP Learning</a> for a beginner’s AI learning journey.</p>
  <h2 id="think-ai-ethics">2. Think AI Ethics</h2>
  <p>Humans give AI systems the data they need to function. But if humans provide biased data to an AI system, then the resulting AI system will perform in biased ways. For example, if we deploy AI systems to screen candidates during the hiring process, and the AI system has been given data biased against certain groups, then the AI system could make discriminatory candidate interviewing recommendations.</p>
  <p>For AI to work in ways that make our world better, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-ethics.html">ethics</a> must be interwoven. AI ethicists promote the positive benefits of AI while mitigating potential risks and ensuring fairness, transparency, and respect for privacy and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/whQ6bFMde2w?feature=share">human values</a> in collaborative processes around developing AI solutions. <a href="https://open.sap.com/courses/aie1">openSAP</a> has a free option to learn the basics.</p>
  <h2 id="build-your-project-management-skills">3. Build Your Project Management Skills</h2>
  <p>Successful AI project development and implementation require skilled <a href="https://learning.sap.com/certification/sap-certified-associate-sap-activate-project-manager-2023">project managers</a>.</p>
  <p>Project managers are critical thinkers. They coordinate cross-functional teams, establish project timelines, watch over budgets and schedules, and ensure effective communication between project stakeholders. You will need to understand AI foundational concepts and oftentimes will need to translate between business users and technical teams. Practice breaking down problems into smaller components, identifying relevant variables, and designing effective solutions.</p>
  <h2 id="brush-up-on-data-science-analytics-and-data-visualization-skills">4. Brush Up on Data Science, Analytics, and Data Visualization Skills</h2>
  <p>AI is only as successful as the data it draws from. Without data, AI systems cannot deliver value. Our customers recognize this as they invest in their data infrastructures as they develop AI applications. When data is valid, accurate, complete, consistent, and uniform across an entire enterprise—and contextualized within the business—AI can deliver relevant results.</p>
  <p>Seek out <a href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journey/explore-sap-customer-data-platform-essentials">learning opportunities</a>, communities, and mentors who can help you learn the different types of data, data collection methods, and data processing techniques. Understand trends and relationships within data. One of the most exciting things about business AI is that there are opportunities to find patterns and insights in data that were formerly undiscoverable. Tools like Python libraries or data analysis platforms like Tableau can be relevant.</p>
  <h2 id="tap-into-governance-accountability-and-responsibility">5. Tap into Governance, Accountability, and Responsibility</h2>
  <p>Collaborative AI systems should have clear safety, governance, accountability, and responsibility frameworks. Frameworks should include structures, processes, and regulatory and risk management practices that align with laws, regulations, policies, ethics principles, and the broader ecosystem. As AI develops across industries and individual companies, there will be a need for people who understand the principles of governance, including how to establish metrics, standards, and accountability practices for an AI system’s behavior.</p>
  <h2 id="embrace-the-journey">Embrace the Journey</h2>
  <p>The rise of AI has transformed the landscape of career opportunities for people — the potential for new, better jobs that will require a mixture of technical and human skills. The demand is there — and growing — for great talent to stand behind the tech! An open mind, genuine curiosity, and a willingness to learn will set you on the right path and will also be necessary as you grow your career.</p>
  <p>I am wishing you well in finding the <a href="http://www.learning.sap.com">right skills</a> toward a role in shaping the future of AI and its impact on society. Here’s to a terrific learning journey!</p>

  <p>I spent many years of my career working on SAP ERP Human Capital Management (HCM) on-premise and it is very near and dear to my heart. But, I am also a big believer in using innovative modern technology to help organizations run their business as efficiently as possible and get the most out of their people. We are seeing an increased urgency for customers to transform their HR operations to improve agility and productivity in a constantly changing world.</p>
  <p>For Maryann Abbajay, chief revenue officer at SAP SuccessFactors, the readiness of many of our customers to begin their cloud HR journeys is accelerating. “So far in 2023, we are seeing increased momentum of SAP on-premise customers moving to the cloud. In the first half of the year, we saw well over 100 customers sign up to move their core HCM or payroll to the cloud,” she said. “We’re gearing up to increase this pace in the second half of the year as well.”</p>
  <p>More importantly, a move to the cloud is about achieving success and better business results, which includes large and complex businesses. Here are a few recent examples of customers that are realizing benefits with the move:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2022/11/80daf380-4d7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Microsoft</a> has been able to create consistent employee experiences worldwide for its 220,000 employees in over 100 countries. With a move to the cloud, it can create jobs much faster and become a more agile business.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.sap.com/asset/dynamic/2023/04/7a53dae4-6c7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Purolator</a> has created organizational agility while providing a better experience for employees. The integration of HR and finance is helping the company make better business decisions.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.sap.com/about/customer-stories/roehm.html">Röhm</a> has been able to standardize its processes leading to significantly reduced HR IT costs. It can now better support and empower employees with a new digital HR experience.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>At SAP SuccessFactors, we continue to make a substantial investment to streamline the transition for our existing customers with focused initiatives. These include the introduction of the SAP Readiness Check tool for SAP SuccessFactors solutions, where we continue to see <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2023/02/17/sap-readiness-check-for-successfactors-customer-momentum/">increased adoption</a> with nearly 150 customers, including those with over 100,000 employees, running it to help jump-start a move to the cloud.</p>
  <p>We’ve also delivered product investments focused on meeting the business requirements of SAP ERP HCM based upon direct customer feedback. This includes enhancements to <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/employee-central-hris.html">SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central</a>, building a leading <a href="/2022/09/sap-industry-leading-time-management-suite">time management suite</a>, and an emphasis on hybrid customers by building enhanced data and process integrations for a best-in-class experience for customers that continue to use on premise along with SAP SuccessFactors solutions.</p>
  <p>A few years ago, I wrote an article on a dozen improvements in SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite, which had a direct comparison between on premise and the cloud. It becomes clear that there are a lot of advantages to moving to SAP SuccessFactors solutions, but in 2023 we face a complex economic landscape and many companies are being intentional about where to invest their time and resources.</p>

  <p>To help customers make the business case, we recently worked with a third-party vendor, Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) by TechTarget, to analyze the economic benefits of moving from SAP ERP HCM to SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite. To complete the analysis, ESG conducted multiple customer interviews, used its industry knowledge, leveraged public data, and evaluated SAP SuccessFactors solutions to build a comprehensive model that compared the cost and benefits of HR operations of SAP SuccessFactors solutions versus continued use of SAP ERP HCM.</p>
  <p>The research contained four categories in which customers would expect to see a benefit: improved experience for all employees, more efficient HR and IT operations, improved business agility and enablement, and unique SAP advantages.</p>
  <p>The result of this analysis validated how organizations can realize over 100% ROI through increased organizational efficiency.

  <p>From planning to go-live and active operation of an SAP SuccessFactors solution, your business can realize significant value from SAP Preferred Success for HXM solutions from SAP, expanded edition. The edition can not only protect your workforce and organizational data and HR applications but can also set the foundation for a long-term partnership that drives continuous knowledge transfer, technical upskilling, and increased awareness of relevant software updates.</p>
  <p>Building on the existing SAP Preferred Success service for HXM solutions from SAP, the edition helps accelerate business transformation success. It can provide extended access to subject-matter experts in cloud adoption, a set of prescriptive reviews of business needs and applications that support daily operations, and assistance with feature adoption. More importantly, you can develop and operate resilient solutions, maximize the value of your cloud investment, and make effective decisions that support business goals.</p>
  <p>Let’s start with <strong>extended access to functional technical resources</strong>. Your HR organization and stakeholders can engage with experts offering the technical and functional guidance you need to understand existing business processes, assess and maximize product usage, and accelerate outcomes. Throughout this service engagement, you can closely collaborate and align future updates, landscape changes, and service delivery and follow-up with a technical and functional resource. The expert can also help orchestrate how-to conversations, review your calendar and plans, and document your landscape.</p>
  <p>Then, with <strong>proactive monitoring</strong>, you can work with an SAP technical resource to oversee the five most critical managed jobs for your business. You and an SAP delivery specialist can create a standard operating procedure for each job, which is used to determine what needs to be done and which actions should be taken if a failure arises.</p>
  <p>Next, an annual <strong>solution stabilization review</strong> of all live modules of your HXM solution investment is conducted. This experience allows you to schedule services required to be completed for each live module and validates usage compared to best practices to identify gaps or improvement opportunities. Moreover, you can gain recommendations for continuous improvement activities and increased adoption over time.</p>
  <p>And last but not least, <strong>new feature activation</strong> is available to help plan, discover, explore, test, enable, and measure the impact of new functionality. Subject-matter experts can kick off the activation process by mapping your success plan as part of an inclusion list and recommending features that best meet your needs. Then, with the help of an SAP delivery specialist, you can activate your chosen feature in a nonproductive landscape, define a testing strategy that contains a base-level unit evaluation, and start testing in a productive environment. During regular touch points, you and your customer success partner can review the usage of the feature and its impact on your business success plan.</p>

An Economist Impact study, sponsored by SAP, found that 50% of organizations plan to increase their use of external workers, which can include independent contractors, consultants, freelancers, temps, and other outsourced labor. It’s critical, therefore, that organizations have a total workforce management strategy that integrates both employees and external workers.</h3>

  <p>Due to changing regulations, the banking sector has faced an increasing demand for workers with specialized skill sets to meet IT and cybersecurity requirements. This has led many finance organizations like Standard Chartered to tap into the external workforce. Today, Standard Chartered’s external workers are integral to how the organization operates. But initially, it lacked the technology and insights to effectively manage them.</p>
  <p>The bank had an over 20-year-old HR system that made it increasingly difficult to innovate and respond quickly to changing business and regulatory requirements, according to Steve Leighton, head of HR Digital Enablement, Standard Chartered and a member of the team undertaking the HR transformation journey since it began in 2017. “We wanted to replace that legacy system, transform, simplify, implement a global process, and really make an improvement in the experience.”</p>
  <p>One strategic requirement stood out as key to the success of the <a href="/topics/human-resources">HR</a> transformation: “How do we join together our permanent employees and our contingent workers to get a total view of the workforce across the organization?” said Leighton, who presented the project results at SAP Sapphire Orlando. “This is a building block in our long-term ambition of being able to perform our strategic workforce planning.”</p>
  <h2 id="hr-transformation-wins-sap-innovation-award">HR Transformation Wins SAP Innovation Award</h2>
  <p>Standard Chartered adopted a total workforce management strategy by integrating <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/employee-central-hris.html">SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central</a> with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/spend-management/contingent-workforce-management.html">SAP Fieldglass</a> solutions in the cloud to help deliver a truly holistic capability across its permanent and contingent workforce. “That kind of integration – [SAP SuccessFactors and SAP Fieldglass] together – was key for this particular transformation,” Leighton said.</p>
  <p>With the implementation of position management, a foundational capability in SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central that helps organizations create and manage job positions to maintain a desired org structure, the organization achieved a breakthrough in its HR transformation journey as the result of its clear strategic vision.</p>
  <p>“One of the key things that set us on a path for a future-ready workforce was really embracing the foundational architecture that position management brings,” McKinley said. “That meant immediately we had a visualization of our total workforce – our contingent and our employee base. It is leading to much stronger data-driven hiring decisions.”</p>
  <p>Standard Chartered remediated 75 interfaces to third-party systems, including outsourced payroll solutions, and migrated 3.5 million data records from its legacy platform. It overhauled processes to achieve an 87% reduction of HR reports. With improved visibility of the entire workforce, where legally permissible, it can now capture richer data for diversity and inclusion metrics to further enable its inclusive culture.</p>
  <p>A clear focus on employee experience has significantly contributed to the transformation’s ongoing success. Applying a “deep” experience approach, the team evaluated each phase and decision in the project for its potential impact on employee experience. Approximately 200 colleagues participated in user acceptance testing, providing valuable feedback through surveys and interviews. Collecting insights post-deployment also enabled the team to continuously innovate and improve the experience. Among the resulting innovations is a new employee portal with a modernized interface that integrates adoption nudges and chatbots to support colleagues during the hiring process.</p>
  <p>“Position management was a key tenet of being able to facilitate this single workforce capability,” said Leighton, who shared learnings from the project, including the effort required for change management to educate and prepare stakeholders and the diligent approach to the data integration. He noted that this effort paid off by “clearly culminating in that success.”</p>
  <p>Standard Chartered recently <a href="https://www.sap.com/idea-place/sap-innovation-awards/entries/2023-award/submission-details.html?idea_id=3637">won an SAP Innovation Award</a> for its success in delivering on total workforce management with a focus on experience.</p>

  <p>“With SAP, we now have a truly holistic view of our permanent and external workers,” McKinley said. “This has not only improved the employee experience and given us richer insights into our entire workforce but has also helped set the foundation for strategic corporate planning, integrated talent management, and management of regulatory requirements.”</p>
  <p>Standard Chartered is now focused on leveraging and expanding future-ready workforce capabilities by using the SAP Analytics Cloud solution for workforce planning. McKinley described how the collaboration of the HR and finance teams is building success for the organization: “We’re working closely with our finance colleagues to bring finance and HR data together a little more seamlessly through the use of SAP Analytics Cloud, with a view to actually making a difference to bottom-up planning through our corporate plan.”</p>
  <p>She noted, “The value that will create, by moving agreed workforce modelling into the position charts, I think will be a game changer for us in terms of our future workforce planning and skills planning.”</p>
  <h2 id="total-workforce-management-from-sap">Total Workforce Management from SAP</h2>

  <p>When fast-growing Mexico-based pharmacy retail chain San Pablo Farmacia faced the same challenge, it found the solution through adopting employee experience management technology. San Pablo Farmacia was established in 1936 and built on traditional customer service values, providing customers throughout Mexico City and beyond with a full-service pharmacy. The company offers over-the-counter medications, natural health products, and home delivery and call center services.

  <p>An important part of the company’s business model is to employ people with no previous experience and allow them to acquire skills, become certified, develop, and grow. Committed to being an employer of choice and wanting to be seen as one of the best companies to work for in Mexico, the company developed an employee experience strategy. It mapped out what it means to be an employer of choice in terms of offering and delivering opportunities for meaningful work and personal growth in a positive work environment.</p>
  <p>To realize this strategy, San Pablo Farmacia would need to put employees at the center of every step of the employment journey. First, attracting and engaging quality talent and expertly managing its large volume of new hires each year called for improvements in its recruitment process. Then, enhancing onboarding and training experiences for new hires while giving everyone access to the relevant systems and data for optimal efficiency required transforming and connecting in a range of talent management processes.</p>
  <p>As the cornerstone of its inclusive and modern approach to talent management, San Pablo Farmacia adopted an integrated, cloud-based HR and talent management solution, which included <a href="https://www.sap.com/cmp/dg/6-drivers-of-future-of-corporate-learning/index.html?source=social-Global-YOUTUBE-MarketingCampaign-CustomerStorytelling-SAPSuccessFactors-spr-10520433441-account_name&#x26;campaigncode=CRM-YA23-SMS-1941768&#x26;sprinklrid=10520433441">learning management</a>. To move from traditional, in-person training to online delivery, San Pablo Farmacia created an intuitive and engaging training experience that employees can consume at their convenience. By integrating the learning solution with other talent management applications, it can design personal training and development plans in line with its growth strategies and the individual needs of the entire workforce. With the introduction of its first online learning program, the company delivered certified training to 1,800 employees without the need to transport its people to a training location and take them away from their pharmacy stores.</p>

  <p>“At SAP and our Real-Time Support channels, support engineers are in the driver’s seat to provide this experience,” states Becky Doyle, global vice president and head of Product Support – People at SAP, the organization that supports human experience management (HXM) solutions from SAP, including SAP SuccessFactors solutions. “Putting the ‘real’ in Real-Time Support is key as we continue to move into the future of how we help our customers, especially in the cloud solution world.”</p>
  <p>In this interview, Doyle explains the “real” aspect of Real-Time Support and how it influences the possibilities behind always-on.</p>
  <h3 id="q-can-you-tell-us-a-bit-more-about-what-you-mean-by-the-real-aspect">Q: Can you tell us a bit more about what you mean by the “real” aspect?</h3>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> Our <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/offerings-programs/strategy.html">Real-Time Support</a> approach offers an always-on support experience. This means that our customers can contact SAP support experts for any problem they have. Sure, we use some cool technology to help make sure we have the answers in the best possible way. But at the heart, it’s a real and human interaction. Anytime a customer gets to work with a real person to solve an issue it creates a feeling of connection. This interaction could be a live voice call with the <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html?anchorId=section_1575600800#section_1575600800">Schedule an Expert</a> service, through a <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html?anchorId=section_519294480#section_519294480">chat in real time</a>, or any other Real-Time Support channel. Embedded into the SAP solution with <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html?anchorId=section_1255553798">Built-In Support</a>, this real-time interaction can create a fantastic connection between customers and our support experts.</p>
  <p>This connection is important and is sometimes a missed opportunity. We need to think of both our customers and support experts as people who work together to solve any problems and make sure the customer’s business runs as smoothly as possible. This feeling of connection through the live channels is valuable for both. My colleague, Mohammed Ajouz, described the criticality of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2023/02/02/customer-support-balancing-act-human-interaction-is-critical/">human interaction</a> in a Forbes article.</p>
  <p>Partnering in real time gives our support experts an increased sense of purpose. It also connects them to what the customer wants to get accomplished. It’s different from having to submit a ticket to then walk through the problem and get the questions answered. The support experts can help a person, a human, with whatever they need to get done and the process can be faster as it solves the problem within a conversation. This is really powerful.</p>
  <h3 id="you-mentioned-the-human-side-of-the-real-time-support-approach-is-there-data-to-show-its-benefits-to-the-customer-experience">You mentioned the human side of the Real-Time Support approach. Is there data to show its benefits to the customer experience?</h3>
  <p>There’s a significant story to tell when we look at the experience our customers have with Real-Time Support. I already talked about the human aspect and the human element of it. When we look at the data, our customers typically get their cases solved faster through Real-Time Support and have a better overall experience. These also often get solved in a single interaction.</p>
  <p>Imagine you have an issue and get your interaction solved as soon as you reach out to somebody. You get your answer in real time, when you need it. We can, of course, tie this time to money. Real-Time Support helps make sure our customers’ business continues to transact and flow the way they need it to. We believe the time-to-value of getting a problem solved helps reduce costs for the customer.</p>
  <p>One key indicator we look at is the overall customer effort. As described in an <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/unveiling-the-new-and-improved-customer-effort-score">article by Gartner</a>, customer effort score is defined as the ease with which customers can use a product or service, resolve a support issue, or find the information they need. When we talk about Real-Time Support, we typically see the customer effort score really improve overall. Customers feel they need to put less effort into their overall support experience or work with our solutions to meet their business needs. This is a powerful human connection to the way we measure how good we are as an organization.</p>

  <p>I am excited about where things are headed for HXM customers. That “X” in the abbreviation really brings out that experience – our human experience management. This is such a powerful shift in the HR space. As our HR solution suite becomes more digital and customers submit cases, more often it’s HR professionals that submit them. These are business users and not necessarily technical contacts. The experience goes beyond fixing the product from a technical perspective; it gets down to how customers use our SAP solutions and what they need to best run their business. Real-Time Support can play a perfect part in bringing that experience home for our customers and our support experts. Being able to support them in real time helps make the overall experience simpler and more personal.</p>
  <p>Real-Time Support helps us be more effective and helps our customers with that human and real interaction. When I talk about it from an HXM perspective, our SAP products and solutions are interconnected to the world’s most important resources – the people using them. We help people get hired faster, trained better, and help them more effectively manage their performance. More importantly, we help provide for their families when our SAP solutions facilitate their pay or can help them make smart decisions on their own career path. When it comes to support, there’s nothing more real than to enable our people to help our customers help their people.</p>
  <h3 id="where-do-you-see-the-future-direction-of-real-time-support">Where do you see the future direction of Real-Time Support?</h3>
  <p>In the cloud space, support can’t simply be an island of helping customers when they come to us. We have the responsibility to work with product management, development, and operations teams across SAP solutions. This close collaboration lets us influence SAP product innovations to make our support more real and to provide that seamless support experience.</p>
  <p>One focus of Real-Time Support is to embed artificial intelligence-driven self-service knowledge capabilities into our SAP products as part of Built-In Support. Not only will customers have that true human interaction, they’ll also be able to receive support information relevant to the SAP solution in use.</p>
  <p>Another future direction in our support transformation goals is to make support more personal for customers and to open a <a href="/2023/05/bi-directional-support-gives-targeted-timely-information">two-way channel of communication</a> from within the SAP product. The goal is to implement resolutions before business disruption can occur and proactively make customers aware of things before they happen. We want to directly connect them with information that’s relevant to the application in use or provide access to a real-time channel directly from within the SAP solution. Both of these capabilities are pretty cool.</p>
  <h3 id="what-do-you-feel-is-important-to-remember">What do you feel is important to remember?</h3>
  <p>I encourage our customers to get “real” with us through Real-Time Support. Try out Real-Time Support channels, especially when the topic could use that human touch. See how it feels to connect with us. Get real information and immediate answers to help you on your way faster.</p>
