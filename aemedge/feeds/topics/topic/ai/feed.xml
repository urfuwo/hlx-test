  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>For thousands of years humans have tried to predict, manage, and control the future. Our ancestors looked for advice from oracles and read the stars. In more recent history, we have turned to science to determine future trends. But a fixed and knowable future doesn’t exist.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>As I look back on 2023, I recognize – with immense gratitude – that I had the privilege of experiencing one of those rare moments in the history of technology when a technology emerges with the potential to completely reshape the future. Typically, the end of the year is a time to reflect and look back, but personally I prefer to look forward and consider how we will adapt to the multitude of possibilities an AI future will bring.</p>

  <p>Generative AI is disrupting every industry, just like the internet did back in the 1990s. Both disruptions have something in common: people are at the center. The internet took off because it was easy for non-technical users to adopt it. This is exactly what’s happening now with AI.</p>
  <p>This signals the need for a skills shift. The World Economic Forum predicts that <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/reskilling-revolution-jobs-future-skills/">more than 40% of skills and 1 billion jobs</a> will change due to new technologies by the end of the decade. Up-skilling and re-skilling are therefore crucial. We can’t know exactly what the future holds, but we can equip people to adapt and thrive in a changing environment.</p>
  <p>In today’s world, it’s not about job security but skills security: recognizing that job security is a by-product of skills security. By acquiring and adapting skills, individuals can position themselves even in the face of automation. Like a bird landing on a branch, it’s not afraid that the branch will break, because it knows it can fly.</p>
  <p>Organizations must also understand their skills gaps so they can anticipate and quickly react to changes. At SAP, we’ve established a globally aligned skills taxonomy and we have prioritized baseline skills for development organizations such as AI, DevOps, and security. These are the most sought-after skills in our industry, and we are making training available to upskill in each of these areas.</p>
  <p>Increased skills transparency across SAP enables us to spot emerging trends, identify where we may have gaps, and prioritize learning investment. We used this process last year to ramp up our investment in AI learning even before the launch of ChatGPT accelerated this need.</p>
  <p>But technical skills are only part of the equation. There’s a common misconception that we all need to develop highly technical or scientific skills to succeed, but I also see a growing need for people who are highly skilled in interacting with other people! That requires a resilient mindset, critical thinking, curiosity, adaptability, flexibility, not to mention creativity, collaboration, and interpersonal skills. Those are core human abilities that are more relevant than ever in the age of AI.</p>
  <p>We need to start enabling children at an early age. This doesn’t mean teaching them how to use a device; they easily master that! But rather it is enabling them to unlock the potential of technology – while using data safely.</p>
  <p>Watching my own children, I see how quickly and naturally they are able to navigate digital devices. But interacting with the data is not something that comes naturally. That must be taught. We need to teach children to interact with data discerningly to set the foundation for a future where they can use technology not just competently, but also responsibly, making informed decisions in a data-driven world. Instead of discouraging their exposure to technology, we should guide children toward a deeper understanding of how they can use it to create, learn, and explore. The goal is not just digital literacy but digital fluency – a profound understanding of technology that goes beyond the surface. Enabling children to be creators, rather than just consumers.</p>
  <p>But we should not even stop there. I am a fan of <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/09/3-of-jack-ma-s-best-pieces-of-advice/">Jack Ma’s advice</a>: “We cannot teach our kids to compete with machines that will be smarter. We must teach our kids something unique, so that a machine can never catch up with us: values, believing, independent thinking, teamwork, care for others – the soft skills, sports, music, painting, arts, to make sure humans are different from machines.”</p>
  <p>I believe a human-AI partnership provides the best of both worlds, creating more value than either can alone. It’s a duet and not a duel. So, companies need to invest in talent as much as technology. And parents, as well as educators, have a crucial role to play in guiding their children toward an AI future.</p>
  <p>Next year will be about taking all people along on the AI transformation journey. Here’s to 2024: an uncertain but exciting future!</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Food security for the world’s growing vulnerable populations is driving <a href="/topics/agriculture">digital agriculture</a> across ecosystems united in providing access to affordable and healthy meals. Statistics reveal the incredible imbalance between supply and demand. While approximately 2.4 billion people worldwide are moderately to severely food insecure, the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/">UN</a> reported that a staggering 931 million tons of food is wasted each year.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The impacts of climate change and geopolitical conflicts coupled with volatile commodity prices and inflation are only exacerbating food supply chain challenges. Food prices are expected to rise 80% by 2050, and crop yields are forecast to decrease up to 30% by 2080. During a recent event at SAP’s Hudson Yards office in New York, agriculture experts and policymakers discussed how organizations in the private and public sector can work together to build a more sustainable food supply.</p>
  <p>“SAP continues to co-innovate with agribusiness leaders to digitalize the farm-to-consume value chain,” said Anja Strothkamper, global vice president of Agribusiness and Commodity Management at SAP. “Every organization in the ecosystem has the opportunity to come together and make a significant contribution towards affordable, efficient, and resilient farming, food production, and distribution. We collaborate across the food chain including agricultural production and farming, origination and trading, commodity processing, food manufacturing and packaging, and retail. These digital ecosystems help companies manage risk, improve decision-making, and maximize crop yields.”</p>
  <p><strong>Data Insights Reduce Complexity for Cost-Efficient Sustainable Farming</strong></p>
  <p>Case in point is the collaboration between SAP and VISTA that uses satellite images and AI-fueled algorithms to create digital twins that can simulate predictive forecasts for optimized decision-making in farming. VISTA is a subsidiary of BayWa, Germany’s largest digital agricultural company. I sat down with Strothkamper and Tobias Fausch, Baywa’s CIO, who shared how working together is cultivating the future of agriculture.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“Satellite imagery plus AI models capture and analyze a wide range of data in digital twins, including soil quality, crop variety and health, water availability, weather conditions, and other farming activities,” said Fausch. “The technology simulates yield predictions, calculating various scenarios based on precise risks by field location and weather patterns. Farmers can automate optimal soil preparation, irrigation and fertilization, crop rotation, and harvest times for sustainable efficiency and high yields. Even with the effects of climate change, these models reveal that we have sufficient resources to better manage global, end-to-end farming for adequate food production.”</p>
  <p>In one example, a soybean farmer in India used VISTA to harvest the highest yield ever, despite a drought in the country. Fausch said that optimizing crop yields sustainably bolsters food security and also makes economic sense.</p>
  <p>“Using the technology, we can automatically calculate the availability of water for not just individual farms, but also a region or country,” said Fausch. “This data can help governments better manage water resources for maximum crop yields in the face of events that make crop yields unpredictable. For example, if there’s a drought in one part of the country, water could be transported into dryer regions for storage and irrigation where it’s needed most.”</p>
  <p><strong>Digital Platform Scales Up Secure Food Supply Chains</strong></p>
  <p>Accessibility to advanced technology is crucial to organizations in the food value chain, especially smallholder farms. The collaboration between SAP and VISTA offers growers of all sizes a simple yet powerful tool to help capture intelligent data in the field using their mobile device. Available on <a href="https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/product/display-2001015636_live_v1/crop-planning-and-logistics-optimizer-by-vista">SAP Store</a>, VISTA is integrated with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/intelligent-agriculture.html">SAP Intelligent Agriculture</a>.</p>
  <p>“The digital twin is the smart superpower, and SAP makes the information available across the digitalized value chain, triggering business processes like automated irrigation and fertilizer services, increased storage and transportation capacities for higher yields, or accurate government subsidy payments for fertilizer,” said Strothkamper. “Public and private sectors can partner to extract value from the predictive modeling data. Farmers can increase yields, banks would have the traceability for investment decisions in startups to grow the economy, insurers can track claims, and governments can better plan and respond to dynamically changing community needs.”</p>
  <p><strong>Generative AI for Intelligent Agriculture</strong></p>
  <p>SAP’s agriculture solutions are evolving to incorporate the latest technologies like AI for valuable business results. An <a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2023/05/96a400eb-737e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">African-based sugar manufacturer</a> uses SAP Intelligent Agriculture to help smallholder farmers digitalize operations, providing advice based on captured data in the field and beyond. Farmers have already improved crop yields based on harvest time guidance.</p>
  <p>“We built this solution through our ongoing collaboration with organizations that are part of the SAP Advisory Council for Agribusiness,” said Strothkamper. “Climate change has rendered time-honored farming practices irrelevant. Generative AI can democratize intelligent agriculture with data-driven insights. Tools based on ChatGPT and other large language models that provide advice based on tremendous amounts of data throughout the ecosystem are the vision for the sustainable food value chain of the future.”</p>

      <div>Artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI, continues to reinvent how we run our businesses and shape the ways people work.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>With Gartner finding more than 80% of enterprises using generative AI application programming interfaces (APIs) or models, and/or deploying generative AI-enabled applications in production environments by 2026, we know there is vast opportunity ahead of us to build the tools and layout the pathways to enable every developer to make an impact.</p>
  <p>We believe <a href="/topics/artificial-intelligence">AI</a> will have a profound effect on the way engineers and developers work in three fundamental ways.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>First, <strong>how</strong> we build our software and applications</li>
    <li>Second, <strong>what</strong> we build into the DevOps cycle tools and platform</li>
    <li>And finally, <strong>who</strong> can code using natural language conversations, extending programming beyond low coders to no coders</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Development will become even more democratized to anyone with great ideas and creativity.</p>

  <p>At SAP, we are at the forefront of business AI. SAP Business AI is about achieving real business results for the enterprise and making AI relevant, reliable, and responsible.</p>
  <p>We have embedded AI capabilities into our solutions including Joule, our new generative AI copilot, which understands your business.</p>
  <p>We are working relentlessly to bring these generative AI use cases to our customers, including educating SAP employees on best practices and providing AI tools internally to accelerate generative AI-embedded product development. We are doing the same for developers. Here are three specific ways SAP is empowering every developer to become an AI developer.</p>
  <h2 id="joule-natural-language-programming">Joule: Natural Language Programming</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-assistant.html">Joule</a>, our generative AI copilot, revolutionizes the way users interact with SAP business systems and data. With Joule, users can easily navigate across SAP applications, find information, execute transactions, collaborate with colleagues, and receive proactive recommendations.</p>
  <p>Instead of conducting laborious manual searches, Joule users can reduce their average search and query time by up to 80% by asking natural language questions and receiving intelligent answers on the wealth of business data and insights available across the SAP portfolio.</p>
  <h2 id="sap-build-code">SAP Build Code</h2>
  <p>Our new application development solution, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/developer-tools.html">SAP Build Code</a>, draws on the power of Joule to create data models, application logic, and test scripts. SAP Build Code provides a simplified developer experience that drives productivity and supports fusion development by teams of professional and citizen developers.</p>
  <h2 id="ai-foundation-on-sap-business-technology-platform">AI Foundation on SAP Business Technology Platform</h2>
  <p>We believe that business AI capabilities need to be directly embedded into business applications and extensions. The <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/business-technology-platform.html">AI Foundation on SAP BTP</a> is a one-stop shop for developers to do exactly that, providing ready-to-use AI services and tools to accelerate the development of generative AI-infused applications, in a secure and trusted way.</p>
  <p>AI Foundation includes everything developers need to run their business-ready AI in the applications they have built on SAP BTP, from ready-to-use AI services to AI runtime and lifecycle management. We provide the tooling for the management of generative AI capabilities and ensure business data connectivity. We designed it with security, governance, and trust from the ground up.</p>
  <h2 id="looking-forward-the-right-model-for-the-right-business-need">Looking Forward: The Right Model for the Right Business Need</h2>
  <p>In early 2024, the AI Foundation will also include a generative AI hub, giving developers instant access to a broad range of large language models (LLMs) from different providers, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT or Falcon-40b. We will soon add more models.</p>
  <p>With this, developers can experiment by submitting a prompt to multiple LLMs to compare the generated outcomes and identify the best model for the task. They can then power mission-critical processes with complete control and transparency with features like built-in prompt history, all delivered with enterprise-grade security and data privacy.</p>
  <p>Our generative AI hub will also provide tooling for developers to supercharge their generative AI development processes and access to tools and techniques to extract the most relevant information from business and other data.</p>
  <p>To get the most value in traditional business areas such as finance, sales, or supply chain, some enterprise customers require foundation models designed specifically for business context. SAP is committed to fine-tuning generic LLMs on SAP anonymized data and, in the longer term, to creating proprietary foundation models based on our vast structured business data.</p>
  <p>These models will be able to address questions that users face every day in business that LLMs cannot, such as predicting invoice payment dates and supplier delivery quality or proposing efficiencies to a business process.</p>
  <p>At SAP, we are building the tools that will enable every developer to become a business AI developer, and in the process to become the true architects of the future.</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Everyone is talking about artificial intelligence (AI) now — and rightly so. Especially in the field of generative AI, artificial intelligence will leave no stone unturned. But another technology is making progress that, in my opinion, will massively revolutionize the business world, if not society. I’m talking about quantum computing.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Leveraging quantum mechanical effects such as superposition, entanglement, and interference, quantum computers could soon be able to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. The disruptive power of quantum already shows promise in fields of application spanning from material science and cryptography to business optimization and <a href="/topics/artificial-intelligence">AI</a>.</p>
  <p>A year ago, I tasked a team within SAP to study the unique features of quantum computers, with the goal to investigate how these features could solve complex business problems more quickly, accurately, and on a larger scale than ever before.</p>
  <p>At the recent <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum/summit/general-session-practitioners-forum">IBM Quantum Summit</a> in New York, we presented the integration of IBM Quantum services into our <a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_ERP/fce9321b57d541ec9ffced02a4322571/f478b65334e6b54ce10000000a174cb4.html?locale=en-US&#x26;version=6.02.latest">vehicle space optimization component</a> as a proof of concept. This marks an important milestone in the progress of quantum computing towards practical, real-world standard business solutions.</p>
  <p>It is SAP’s mission as world-leading enterprise application provider to deliver the benefits of quantum computing via our solutions to our customers.</p>
  <p>While still a proof of concept, this engine’s connection to quantum systems demonstrates the potential for quantum computing to solve real-world business problems, such as packing a truck with assorted beverages, using a fundamentally new approach. Instead of simulating every possible packing combination, the quantum solver leverages the inherent parallelism of quantum to evaluate multiple possibilities, showing how to find a significantly superior solution than a classical computer.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In recognition of the rapidly evolving quantum computing ecosystem, SAP partnered with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum">IBM</a>, which offers a comprehensive suite of quantum hardware, software, and services accessible via the IBM Cloud and has an impressive multi-year technology road map.</p>
  <p>How did we approach this?</p>
  <p>Our exemplary standard component, vehicle space optimization, is directly leveraging quantum computing capabilities, fully automized within our application and technology environment. At the core of this innovation is the enhancement of SAP’s optimization engine through the incorporation of a potent quantum solver.</p>
  <p>Quantum optimization today is about tackling quadratic optimization problems. We augmented the optimization engine with the capabilities to map a business problem to such a quadratic formulation to then feed the quantum computer. This allows us to leverage different algorithms; for example, the well-known <a href="https://qiskit.org/documentation/stable/0.40/tutorials/algorithms/05_qaoa.html">QAOA</a>. The results coming back from the quantum computer, which are inherently probabilistic, are then post-processed within the optimization engine.</p>
  <p>Going one level deeper into the specifics, while high-level programming languages are common in classical computing, quantum computers today are programmed by formulating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate">quantum circuits at gate-level</a>. With our approach, we encapsulate the complex specific implementation of the quantum circuit within our engine, so that ultimately our ecosystem — customers, consultants, developers — will be able to leverage quantum computing for business problems without studying quantum physics.</p>
  <p>Despite the excitement surrounding these developments, SAP acknowledges that quantum computers in the current noisy intermediate scale quantum computing (NISQ) era are still too small and too noisy to deliver superior results directly. However, significant progress in the scale and quality of quantum computing in recent years prompted SAP’s collaboration with IBM to explore the current frontier of quantum computing.</p>
  <p>The integration of IBM Quantum systems into SAP’s cloud-native optimization service results in a platform to address the gaps that need to be bridged in the coming years. This significant step marks a crucial milestone in SAP’s journey toward the next generation of enterprise software for better business operations and value creation.</p>
  <p>As SAP continues to push the boundaries of what is possible, the industry watches with anticipation, ready for a future reshaped by quantum computing.</p>

  <p><strong>Sun:</strong> Like with other major technology shifts, such as the breakthrough of the Internet, consumer understanding and adoption pave the way for more rapid business adoption. I think the same thing is happening in generative AI. The rapid consumer awareness of artificial intelligence, especially generative AI, in the past year was largely due to the November 2022 Chat GPT consumer release opening the door for AI and business applications.</p>
  <p>Practically speaking, I’m seeing a crawl, walk, run approach to adoption. First of all, business leaders want to see it work. So, they’re going to try it out with close supervision and in smaller, more cautious ways to start.</p>
  <p>After they’ve gained some trust, they’ll deploy it more broadly. Later, they will be so comfortable that they’ll use it in all lines of their business. That will be a great opportunity for SAP to help these businesses crawl, then walk, then run through this process.</p>
  <p><strong>Where do you see the biggest opportunity for SAP in the AI space?</strong></p>
  <p>As a global leader in business applications, we can play a very big role in shaping how businesses adopt AI. It’s very exciting to be at the forefront of technology and also be in a position to do it responsibly.</p>
  <p>At SAP, we want to grow trust from our customers. As you know, SAP Business AI is relevant, reliable, and responsible. This position is deeply rooted in adhering to EU data protection laws. We have content filters, data provenance checks, and other features to help ensure accurate and reliable results. Our ethically responsible handling of AI helps ensure that customers can trust how we’re building these capabilities.</p>

  <p>We are built for business: we have the deep knowledge and the shipped capabilities to make AI work for our customers. They know what their pain points are, and we can figure out how to solve the problem with technology. This is also about democratizing information for everybody, and we’re democratizing the ability for all businesses – large and small – to use AI.</p>
  <p>I think we can use SAP’s unique selling point, which is our access to business data combined with this strong data privacy and protection standards, to get customers to understand that they can trust our technology. With <a href="/2023/09/joule-new-generative-ai-assistant">Joule</a>, SAP is already shipping generative AI capabilities and, as we saw at <a href="/2023/11/sap-teched-cto-juergen-mueller-generative-ai-development">SAP TechEd</a>, we have plans for delivering more both in product and for our developers in SAP Business Technology Platform.</p>
  <p><strong>How do we balance the urgency of innovation with the prudence of ethical consideration in the deployment of AI?</strong></p>
  <p>I think AI ethics is an extremely important part of our equation. Trust takes years to earn but can be lost in seconds with one failure or one mistake. At SAP, we have made investments in <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/ai-ethics.html">AI ethics</a> to ensure we’re building responsible AI for our customers. This includes fairness, explainability and transparency, reliability, and safety. It also includes having accuracy of information, privacy, and security in place. We also have our SAP AI Global Ethics Steering Committee helping to ensure further safeguards.</p>
  <p>If we miss any aspect of this, we run a risk of breaking trust and moving backwards in our fast push to progress. From talking to customers, I’ve been reaffirmed that they want to know what’s going on under the hood.</p>
  <p>This is not just for knowing so they can share with their company leaders, but to help everyone be comfortable with generative AI because it is new to everybody. People are a little bit cautious as to what is possible, and they want to know what’s happening.</p>
  <p>The more we can explain, the more we show that we have the technology under control, the more comfort people will have in adopting and using it, which then creates that flywheel of more usage, more trust, and more adoption.</p>
  <p><strong>How do you view the collaboration between academia and industry?</strong></p>
  <p>With any new innovation, having the collaborative effort is really important to move fastest.</p>
  <p>As someone who has worked both in academia and industry, I see exciting opportunities in collaboration. At SAP, we want to build bridges, not silos. Let’s acknowledge academic priorities of publishing papers and state-of-the-art science and ask ourselves, “How can we partner so that it is a win-win situation for both of us?”</p>
  <p>We collaborate with academic research institutions to understand what state-of-the-art development is in the pipeline. Our role is to provide business knowledge and use cases and then merge that with the research scenarios to identify what could be practically implemented and be valuable to our customers.</p>
  <p>SAP’s relationships with many top institutions, such as Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, and Technische Universität München, are really great. Our membership into <a href="/2023/11/sap-joins-stanford-hai-corporate-affiliate-program">the Stanford HAI program</a> is a specific example. Beyond the research collaborations, the relationships help ensure that the best graduates from these universities think of SAP when looking for their first job and guarantee that we’re on top of the latest technology.</p>

        <h1 id="how-the-cloud-and-ai-will-help-more-companies-become-future-proof">How the Cloud and AI Will Help More Companies Become Future Proof</h1>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>When speaking with IT leaders from the world’s largest companies about their greatest business challenges, there’s one thing I hear often. They all want to be future proof, where their operations become more flexible and resilient so they can bounce back faster to unforeseen challenges.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It’s easy to see why. In a world where macroeconomic uncertainty has become the new normal, being future proof is no longer a “nice to have.” It’s a must have. One of the ways that many companies are getting there is by becoming smarter and more strategic about their IT planning and preparing for an AI-powered future.</p>
  <p>I’m sure you’ve heard the phrase, “Work smarter, not harder.” The same is true when it comes to resiliency planning.</p>
  <p>Businesses can become more resilient in many ways, from optimizing production with supply chain planning to better leveraging data to diversifying their suppliers, as well as by giving their workforce new tools and training to become future ready. While organizations always need to be able to respond quickly to operational disruptions and have a flexible contingency plan in place, true resiliency comes from being able to forecast and anticipate disruptions before they happen to avoid them altogether.</p>
  <p>Today, businesses have a golden opportunity to do this by moving their ERP systems to the cloud. Among many other benefits, the cloud allows them to react faster to the unexpected, scale their operations without requiring massive investments in hardware, and make it easier for teams to collaborate when troubleshooting a problem. We all saw a global case study in how the cloud can support resiliency when the pandemic hit in 2020. Companies that had moved their operations to the cloud were able to pivot far faster to the new realities of having a workforce that couldn’t be together physically.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">

        <h3 id="see-how-companies-like-yours-are-succeeding-with-innovative-products-services-and-technologies-from-sap">See how companies like yours are succeeding with innovative products, services, and technologies from SAP</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/about/customer-stories.html">Read their stories</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In my role at SAP, every day I see plenty of examples of customers using the cloud to work smarter and make their businesses more resilient.</p>
  <p>Take, for instance, Nestlé S.A, which has been in business for more than 150 years. The company produces some of the most beloved brands in food, beverages, and nutritional products around the world. It has been an SAP customer for over 20 years and recently selected RISE with SAP to transform in the cloud. As a result, they’ll be able to automate processes across operations, create innovative business models at scale, and achieve greater agility and resilience.</p>
  <p>We’ve also worked with Watco, a leading transportation and logistics provider, to streamline its financial planning, forecasting, and reporting processes. SAP Analytics Cloud helped the company get access to a profit and loss account for each of its 200 individual locations as well as a comprehensive, consolidated company view. It has connected 320 team members, allowing them to collaborate on enterprise plans with one source of information across their locations to be better prepared for the unexpected.</p>
  <p>But this is just the beginning. While having ERP systems in the cloud is essential for making any business future proof, the benefits become even greater when <a href="/topics/artificial-intelligence">AI</a> solutions are also built right into cloud solutions. AI promises to be a force multiplier. Together with the cloud, business AI has the potential to help companies become true systems of intelligence where speed and agility meet data and insight.</p>
  <p>Every journey is different. But there is simply no doubt that businesses that are willing to invest in the latest cloud and business AI solutions with a trusted partner like SAP will be able to future proof in ways that were previously unimaginable. And this is the most important thing they can do to thrive in an uncertain world.</p>
  <p>In 2023, we saw what is possible when generative AI for business is specifically tailored to the unique business context of the company using it. With this in mind, I’m predicting that because of the <a href="/2023/12/generative-ai-show-me-the-money-moment">growing power of generative AI</a> for business — especially when it is embedded in ways that are relevant, reliable, and responsible — 2024 will be a watershed year for resiliency planning.</p>
  <p>Those who are willing to make it central to their transformation journeys will open themselves up to new models and revenue streams that will become proof of their future promise.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Most organizations are at a critical juncture with their data. They recognize the importance of harnessing data intelligently. But using 80% to 90% of that useful information – primarily hidden in unstructured sources such as e-mails, customer chats, phone calls, invoices, videos, and other digital artifacts – is increasingly challenging.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>When lacking the structure of metadata or attributes necessary for application, algorithm, and machine utilization, data is not only left unused but also accumulates in high volumes. This data management approach inevitably exacerbates IT complexity and consumes valuable storage resources. And even worse, organizations need insights that cannot be found elsewhere.</p>
  <p>A <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/08/9cbf9a15-897e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Process Excellence Network</a> report, co-sponsored by SAP, reveals that some organizations are addressing this challenge by embracing intelligent document processing (IDP) technology. Enriched with <a href="/topics/ai">AI</a> capabilities, this next-generation tool is becoming a vital ally for process optimization, innovation, and delivering exceptional user experiences.</p>
  <h2 id="what-is-intelligent-document-processing">What Is Intelligent Document Processing?</h2>
  <p>Unlike traditional template-based approaches, IDP solutions employ computer vision and natural language processing to scan documents containing unstructured data, such as invoices, receipts, and contracts. The information on these documents is then extracted using a combination of robotic process automation (RPA) and machine learning to help ensure accuracy and integrated into larger business systems. Finally, all this information is converted into machine-readable data and interpreted into actionable insights.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">

        <h3 id="go-from-analytics-to-action-with-ai-powered-intelligent-document-processing">Go from analytics to action with AI-powered intelligent document processing</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2023/09/6a11431a-8f7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Watch the webinar</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It’s essential to note that IDP goes beyond mere document reading, decoding, and translation. It also accelerates data use by improving processing accuracy and providing immediate access for humans and machines. The extracted information is contextually aligned with business rules, integrated into downstream systems like SAP S/4HANA Cloud, and applied to real-world process automation, business scenarios, and decision-making.</p>
  <p>However, the real advantage of such streamlined, document-centric processes becomes more evident when they align with an organization’s competitive goals, stepping up decision-making speed and unlocking valuable data-driven insights.</p>
  <h2 id="how-idp-bridges-the-gap-between-data-and-knowledge">How IDP Bridges the Gap Between Data and Knowledge</h2>
  <p>An <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/01/629d79f0-127e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">IDC business value white paper</a> reported that IDP solutions – such as <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/enterprise-content-management.html">SAP enterprise content management (ECM) solutions by OpenText</a> – help bridge content silos and reduce frustration and time by expediting information flow while expanding governance. As a result, organizations using the technology can experience profound team productivity improvement and extensibility across the globe, making it easier to work from anywhere and at any time.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2021/03/5040f854-d67d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html">Old World Industries LLC</a> (OWI), which sells motor oil, antifreeze, fuel additives, and other automotive chemicals in more than 60 countries, is a prime example of a business experiencing similar operational upgrades. The company implemented the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/financial-management/invoice-management.html">SAP Invoice Management application by OpenText</a> as part of the SAP ECM solutions by OpenText portfolio to bring the speed that customers associate with its brands to its accounts payable processes. This strategic move eliminated the roadblocks that manual processes dependent on paper and e-mail posed to OWI’s overall efficiency, especially as the workforce continued to work remotely.</p>
  <p>By integrating SAP Invoice Management with its existing accounts payable applications, OWI advanced its journey toward finance digitalization with embedded AI technologies, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Machine learning</strong> technology that can analyze documents and bypass error-prone data-entry steps</li>
    <li><strong>Character recognition</strong> capabilities to help automatically flag duplicate invoices and detect invoicing and payment errors</li>
    <li><strong>A centralized point of control and access</strong>, which can provide a unified user experience across accounts payable applications for data access, analysis, collaboration, and decision-making</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to fast-tracking its invoicing processes, the IDP application enabled OWI’s accounts payable employees to prioritize their workload, shifting their attention from data entry to timely invoice validation and resolution. And now that detailed histories of invoices are available all in one place, the team can analyze individual vendors in a few clicks to identify opportunities and mitigate potential risks early.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Based on IDC’s survey of organizations using SAP ECM solutions by OpenText, the combined benefits of content digitalization, automation, and integration can lead to annual revenue growth of over US$7 million.</p>
  <p>This remarkable outcome comes with an added gain of 4,794 productive hours, increasing gross business productivity by 21%. Furthermore, enhanced interdepartmental document sharing and process automation contributed to an even greater boost in profitability, with savings of $3.82 million for every set of 1 million documents.</p>
  <h2 id="why-the-value-of-idp-technology-continues-to-build">Why the Value of IDP Technology Continues to Build</h2>
  <p>Echoing similar advantages reported by IDC, the Process Excellence Network predicts that future advancements in AI will further strengthen the fundamental value of IDP solutions. This is particularly apparent with recent innovations in generative AI, encompassing deep-learning models capable of producing text, images, videos, and diverse content.</p>
  <p>By embracing generative AI, for example, IDP can be poised to transcend structured data extraction to generate high-quality, context-sensitive content and augment the swiftness and precision of data processing. It will soon empower large language models – such as chatbots and voice user interfaces – to yield profound, contextually rich insights that can be applied for automated decision-making and content generation.</p>
  <p>As one survey respondent says, “The combination of IDP and generative AI will further enhance our content automation capabilities, enabling us to automate complex document generation tasks and deliver personalized and tailored experiences to our customers.”</p>
  <p>To explore more insights about the future of intelligent document processing, read the Process Excellence Network report, “<a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/08/9cbf9a15-897e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Go from Analytics to Action with AI-Powered Intelligent Document Processing</a>,” co-sponsored by SAP and OpenText.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>In the highly competitive markets of today, businesses are pushing boundaries be it in product and service portfolios, operations, or partner and vendor relationships. We see this with our customers, too. They need their support requests to be resolved quickly and implementation projects to be managed efficiently.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To serve these requirements, SAP has provided customers and partners with separate learning and assessment courses on our support offerings, enabling them with support tools and resources that help maximize their <a href="/topics/support">support experience</a>. While our customers could benefit from Product Support Accreditation in the past, our partners had access to an equally in-demand enablement course, “Support and Success Essentials for SAP Cloud Solutions.”</p>
  <p>Both versions have had great success and it was time to consolidate the best parts of these two accreditations into one impactful learning offering. As of December 5, 2023, we have merged these two options into <a href="https://learning.sap.com/learning-journey/getting-started-with-support-from-sap-support-accreditation">Support Accreditation</a>, making it SAP’s baseline support enablement for all consultants.</p>
  <p>What is this new offering in a nutshell? Support Accreditation is a course and assessment that enables customers and partners to make the best use of SAP’s support offerings and tools. This accreditation is available for all customers and partners of SAP – at no additional cost.</p>

  <p>To learn more about the latest developments on the topic, I sat down with Stefan Steinle, executive vice president and head of Customer Support &#x26; Innovation, SAP SE.</p>
  <p><strong>Q: Can you give a brief description of Support Accreditation?</strong></p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> This training was developed to showcase all the available support services and tools provided by SAP. We cannot assume that our customers and partners have the bandwidth to research what’s available – and this does not just apply to support, it applies to all our offerings at SAP. We have proactively curated all the tools and related resources that can assist our customers and partners in resolving their issues effectively and efficiently. The four-module course is packed with focus topics, one-page snapshots, how-to videos, and interactive quizzes. As with any course, all eligible participants receive a digital Support Accreditation badge.</p>
  <p><strong>What about the actual content of the training? What areas are covered?</strong></p>
  <p>The course introduces you to <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/offerings-programs/strategy.html?anchorId=section_277629229">Real-Time Support</a> channels like Expert Chat, Schedule an Expert, Schedule a Manager, and Ask an Expert Peer, which can enable customers and partners to have direct contact with support. For example, with Schedule an Expert, a customer can have a 30-minute session with an expert to help resolve a specific issue related to a support request. This is valuable information that consultants need.</p>
  <p>Participants can benefit from similar how-to’s and guides on self-service, case prevention, live support channels, and supplementary material. We have a unit on <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/alm.html?anchorId=section">SAP Cloud ALM</a>, our application lifecycle management solution that is included in cloud subscriptions. This is a fantastic module that guides users on how they can benefit from an out-of-the-box, cloud-native solution designed as the central entry point to manage customers’ SAP landscape with content-driven, guided implementation and highly automated operations.</p>
  <p><strong>To manage expectations, could you also elaborate on what is not covered by this accreditation?</strong></p>
  <p>Expert course content is not covered in this accreditation. For example, we have further deep dives for SAP Cloud ALM that are, understandably, not covered in this first-level accreditation.</p>
  <p>Also, this is a learning offering around support topics so enablement on solution knowledge is not in scope.</p>
  <p><strong>What’s in it for customers? What is the benefit of the course?</strong></p>
  <p>Not every customer is fully aware of the complete suite of support tools. With the Support Accreditation course, they can learn to easily engage with our support teams and to achieve smoother case resolutions. We provide easy-to-use, easy-to-consume self-enablement to any customer or partner at no additional cost. It is a must for all those who interact with the support channels of SAP.</p>
  <p><strong>What about partners?</strong></p>
  <p>This training is especially important for partners as most implementation projects are run or supported by them. They also manage most ongoing operations on behalf of the customer.</p>
  <p>Both customers and SAP expect partners to manage customer projects and operations with high quality based on SAP’s best practices. These include methodologies, tools, services, and procedures – especially those dealing with upcoming issues.</p>
  <p>We highly recommend the Support Accreditation training – and the resulting badge – for every partner consultant.</p>
  <p><strong>What have been the biggest changes you have seen in the course?</strong></p>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="discover-what-sap-cloud-alm-has-to-offer">Discover what SAP Cloud ALM has to offer</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://support.sap.com/en/alm.html?anchorId=section">Find out</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>With every growth milestone at SAP, you can be sure that there is a corresponding ripple in the world of support. Therefore, we take a lot of effort to keep the training content up-to-date. For example, we now have a whole new unit dedicated to SAP Cloud ALM. We are also moving to <a href="https://learning.sap.com/">learning.sap.com</a>, having been a standalone application previously. This is a huge development, as the course is now available in the public space. Anyone can participate now that it is opened to a wider audience. Upon successful completion of the course, participants receive a record of achievement.</p>
  <p>We are increasingly moving from a reactionary model to one that is more real-time and predictive. We have AI-powered support offerings that help enrich the customer experience – for example, new features in Incident Solution Matching.</p>
  <p><strong>Will customers and partners still be able to get their Support Accreditation badge now that the training has moved to the SAP Learning site?</strong></p>
  <p>Absolutely. I must say this is a very popular badge in the ecosystem.</p>
  <p>The Support Accreditation badge indicates that the participant has completed the course and has the requisite knowledge to navigate SAP’s support channels and offerings. This badge can be used on social media and can also be included in your signature when you interact with our support teams.</p>
  <p><strong>More broadly, how do you use AI in support enablement?</strong></p>
  <p>We use large language models (LLMs) to refine and expand the scope of our existing AI-driven solutions. Based on the learnings from Enhance AI and Assist Support, we utilize LLMs to help generate automated responses to specific how-to questions. This allows us to leverage SAP Knowledge Base Articles, SAP Notes, and documentation contributions from our experts.</p>
  <p><strong>How popular is the course?</strong></p>
  <p>Approximately 5,000 customers and partners take part in the course and get their accreditation every year! People who complete the training have the option to provide feedback and rate the content. Currently, the course has a rating of 4.75 out of 5. The numbers speak for themselves!</p>
  <p><strong>Where do you see the course going in the future?</strong></p>
  <p>As always, we keep it simple – to help you simplify your support priorities. As I said before, the content reflects the ever-changing market growth and business requirements around us. We encourage our customers and partners to renew their Support Accreditation badges once a year to get an update on improvements and enhancements.</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>In a key scene from the 1996 movie “Jerry Maguire,” a pro football player is in the midst of contract negotiations with the Arizona Cardinals. He gets tired of his agent Jerry’s slick sales pitch and shouts at him in exasperation: “Show me the money!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This is the very spot the world finds itself with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/what-is-generative-ai.html">generative AI</a>. We’re past the hype and slick generative AI sales pitches.</p>
  <p>Business leaders now want results. They are demanding tech vendors show them the money — the actual business value delivered by generative AI.</p>
  <h2 id="the-big-picture">The Big Picture</h2>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="what-is-artificial-intelligence">What is artificial intelligence?</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/what-is-artificial-intelligence.html">Get an overview</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>At a macro level, generative AI’s impact on productivity could add trillions of dollars in value to the global economy. McKinsey’s latest research estimates that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across just the 63 use cases the consultancy firm analyzed — by comparison, the UK’s entire GDP in 2021 was $3.1 trillion.</p>
  <p>SAP is uniquely positioned to deliver on the promise of generative AI. We deliver the broadest suite of enterprise applications that maintain customers’ most mission-critical data. When this data is combined with the power of AI, it can truly revolutionize the way business runs.</p>
  <p>Here are just a few examples of how we’re already showing customers the money with generative AI.</p>
  <h2 id="supply-chain-automation">Supply Chain Automation</h2>
  <p>We’ve built generative AI into the SAP Transportation Management solution to speed up freight verification and documentation for manufacturing customers.</p>
  <p>This transforms a historically cumbersome task that’s often still done on paper into a quick, automated, and fully digitized process. Expediting freight processing time with this capability translates into real money, delivering nearly $1 million in annual savings at a single warehouse facility — a savings customers with multiple such facilities can realize many times over.</p>
  <h2 id="human-capital">Human Capital</h2>
  <p>Delta Air Lines is another customer working toward using SAP’s business AI. <a href="/2023/09/generative-ai-employee-experience-delta">Delta</a> is an early adopter of the talent intelligence hub built into SAP SuccessFactors. Delta Air Lines is developing a generative AI proof of concept slated to automatically transform generic skill descriptions into more accurate capabilities that reflect the job’s requirements based on real-world, updated employee and customer data in context.</p>
  <p>To help employees move from an hourly, customer-facing role to the salaried corporate position of their dreams, Delta Air Lines is building a dynamic, skills-based experience for continuous employee learning using the talent intelligence hub in SAP SuccessFactors solutions. Individual employees have a growth portfolio, which is a profile that includes their current skills and competencies mapped to formal and informal learning opportunities within and outside the organization, some recommended by AI-based algorithms.</p>
  <h2 id="intelligent-collections">Intelligent Collections</h2>
  <p>Suppliers always face the risk that some of their customers won’t pay on time. Late payments impact liquidity planning and working capital requirements.</p>
  <p>Collection management for SAP S/4HANA intelligently analyzes historical data and identifies customers and invoices with a higher risk for late payment. The solution reduces customer billing, credit, and collections costs. In one customer study, the solution enabled a consumer products producer with 30,000 employees to realize up to an extra $2.9 million in earnings annually.</p>
  <h2 id="natural-language-questions-quick-intelligent-answers">Natural Language Questions. Quick, Intelligent Answers</h2>
  <p>As these examples show, time is money. <a href="/topics/joule">Joule</a>, SAP’s generative AI copilot, helps customers save even more of it.</p>
  <p>It’s like tapping your smartest coworker on the shoulder to get instant and accurate insights. Users can ask plain-language questions of Joule, which pulls reliable and relevant information from across SAP’s cloud portfolio, instead of manually hunting for answers across systems.</p>
  <p>In one Joule test, information and insights about transactional data were achieved an average of 10 minutes faster compared to manual searching and analysis. For the user, that means more time available for higher level tasks. And, for the business, that adds up across the enterprise to real resource and cost savings.</p>
  <h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h2>
  <p>This is just the beginning. We can expect that 2024 will see generative AI solutions create even more value for customers around the world.</p>
  <p>We <a href="https://www.sap.com/events/teched/news-guide.html">recently launched a number of AI innovations</a> — from AI-infused coding tools to a one-stop shop to create generative AI extensions and applications — that give the developers at <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/what-is-artificial-intelligence.html">the heart of the AI</a> revolution the tools they need to transform the way businesses run.</p>
  <p>Who knows? Soon Joule may be the one to tap you on the shoulder with an offer to “Help me help you!”</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div><a href="https://www.colesgroup.com.au/home/">Coles Group</a>, one of Australia’s most trusted and iconic brands, is steadfast in delivering on its purpose to help Australians eat and live better every day. Through its core business as a full-service supermarket retailer, Coles engages with millions of customers every week in its 860 supermarkets throughout Australia. The group’s other areas of business include its Click &#x26; Collect online platform, network of liquor stores, and financial services with nearly 1,000 additional retail outlets.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Guided by the organization’s clear <a href="https://colescareers.com.au/au/en/culture">vision, purpose, and strategy</a>, Coles’ team of 120,000 employees is dedicated to making a difference in the lives of customers and the local communities it serves.</p>
  <p>In fiscal year 2020/21, Coles Group hired nearly 30,000 people to deliver on its business needs. Mike Virgo, head of Talent Acquisition for Coles Group, said this hiring volume was necessary to make sure the company was “positioned well to support our customers.”</p>
  <p>The business environment, however, dramatically shifted as the public health crisis of the pandemic unfolded, resulting in repeated lockdowns and restrictions. As a neighborhood retailer dependent on in-person interaction to deliver most of its services, Coles found its workforce impacted by the pandemic. Faced with supply chain disruptions, panic buying behaviors by consumers, high employee absenteeism, and increased turnover, Coles urgently needed to step up its volume and pace of hiring to support its customers.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“Around 2020-2021, we started to experience one of the most significant shifts in the employment market we’d ever seen,” Virgo said in a <a href="https://go3.events.sap.com/successconnect/virtual/2023/reg/flow/sap/sc23/catalog/page/catalog/session/1693098679863001ykJ6">session</a> at <a href="https://www.sap.com/events/successconnect/virtual.html?campaigncode=CRM-YI23-HXM-2055448&#x26;source=text-glo-SAPNews">SuccessConnect Virtual</a>. “It started to create huge challenges for organizations around the world – around how we attract, retain, and hire talent.”</p>
  <h2 id="catalyst-for-change-and-a-new-way-of-working">Catalyst for Change and a New Way of Working</h2>
  <p>To meet pressing business demands, Coles doubled its hiring volume from 30,000 to 60,000 people and increased recruitment advertising spend by a factor of three. Its talent acquisition team grew proportionally to manage the increased workload – but then labored under manual transactional activities that slowed processing times. As a result of the huge strain, variability in the candidate and hiring manager experience became noticeable.</p>
  <p>Due to the volume of work, Coles looked for ways to evolve its system to create more speed, efficiency, and scalability. With a list of criteria, Coles began to review technology solutions on the market to find one that could support its vision for a new way of working. “We wanted to reimagine how we recruit for our stores,” Virgo said. “We needed automation and AI to remove a lot of the manual work in our systems. We wanted to create more consistency and uplift the experiences we were giving our candidates and our hiring managers. And ultimately, [the solution] needed to drive commercial benefit for us.”</p>
  <p>As a key requirement, the new solution needed to integrate with <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/what-is-hxm-suite.html">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite</a>. In 2020, as part of an organization-wide <a href="/australia/2021/09/08/how-coles-group-is-transforming-hr-during-the-global-pandemic">digital transformation</a> that introduced SAP S/4HANA and SAP Ariba solutions, Coles modernized its HR and payroll processing, replacing a patchwork of outdated systems with SAP SuccessFactors solutions. It became the first organization in the southern hemisphere to launch all modules of the SAP SuccessFactors portfolio in one go. With all HR processes unified on a single platform, Coles benefits from having a single source of truth for people data that is accurate and available in real time for the entire organization.</p>
  <h2 id="two-way-integration-ensures-single-source-of-truth-in-data">Two-Way Integration Ensures Single Source of Truth in Data</h2>
  <p>To help with the project, Coles chose <a href="https://www.phenom.com/">Phenom</a>, an SAP partner whose AI-powered Intelligent Talent Experience platform provides two-way integration with SAP SuccessFactors solutions. Virgo said the two-way integration “allows us to have a holistic view of the candidates that progress through the process, no matter whether the team is operating in Phenom or SAP SuccessFactors, and it allows SAP SuccessFactors to be our single source of truth.”</p>
  <p>There are several key benefits of Phenom’s solution at Coles. One is candidate attraction and engagement, which is achieved primarily through the Coles career site and chatbot. Another is recruiter automation and interview management, which provides automation and process efficiencies from when a job requisition is created in SAP SuccessFactors solutions and replicated into Phenom until a hiring manager chooses a candidate for the job. Once a candidate is chosen, the two-way integration enables the HR team to access the data in SAP SuccessFactors solutions and complete all compliance aspects, such as working rights, contract generation, and onboarding.</p>

  <p>The Coles team gains additional efficiencies in its onboarding programs through the application of robotic process automation (RPA) powered by two bots that work in the background: <em>Ashbotty</em> processes the working rights and <em>Usain Bot</em> processes onboarding and manages pending recruits. “They take a lot of the transactional, manual work that we used to have team members doing. It can do that quickly, accurately, and it can do that 24/7 – which is particularly important for us as a seven-days-a-week business,” Virgo said.</p>
  <h2 id="ai-powered-experiences-for-candidates-and-recruiters">AI-Powered Experiences for Candidates and Recruiters</h2>
  <p>Coles reimagined the candidate experience to launch a modern, tech-enabled career site – which has been chosen as a two-time winner of Australia’s Best Careers Site. The site includes an AI-powered chatbot to guide candidates as they look for information, search relevant job postings, and submit their applications. It also includes Coles’ Expression of Interest, always-on advertising that drives the growth of its talent pool and advances its talent marketing by reducing the need to advertise every role. A Hosted Apply process, facilitated by integrations with Phenom, presents a consistent candidate experience and increases the conversion rate on applications.</p>
  <p>Phenom AI Scheduling, a key part of Coles’ hiring experience, enables candidates to book themselves an available interview slot and automates the coordination of hiring team calendars. The new solution provides a fully mobile-enabled experience to meet the demands of candidates for an omni-channel, real-time experience where they can learn, read, and apply for jobs where and when they want.</p>
  <p>Inundated by nearly 1 million applications each year to review, Coles also took steps to elevate the recruiter experience and increase the speed and accuracy of candidate screening and job matching. It implemented Phenom Fit Score, an AI-powered feature that assesses a candidate’s suitability for an open role, based on location and optimal travel distances, availability, and working rights; then, assigns a fit score and surfaces the most closely matched candidates to the recruiters. In addition, the new solution empowers in-store managers to collaborate with recruiters to review candidates and make quick hiring decisions with confidence.</p>

  <p>With the new augmented solution, Coles is experiencing tangible benefits across multiple categories and key metrics for success: time-to-fill is down six days; time-to-hire is down two days, which is impressive considering candidates can book the in-store interview up to two weeks in advance; and advertising spend is down 50%.</p>
  <p>Most notably for Coles as a people-centric organization is the development of its talent pool, now numbering 2 million potential candidates. It achieves an 85% application conversion rate on up to 1 million applications per year. Through its <a href="https://www.colesgroup.com.au/media-releases/?page=coles-group-ranked-1-for-recruitment-of-aussies-with-disabilities">commitment</a> to be a safe, inclusive, and diverse workplace, Coles has applied the new solution to provide greater accessibility for more diverse candidates, resulting in an increase of 24% more hiring for people who identify as having a disability.</p>
  <p>Virgo said that the talent acquisition team will continue to evolve its solution and assess more opportunities for AI and automation to bring value to the recruitment process. Although these technologies are not cure-alls for every recruitment scenario, they can save recruiting teams precious time and resources to focus on more high-touch interactions further down the recruiting funnel. In sharing lessons learned, Virgo noted, “I think the important call out is the level of automation you can inject in your process will likely diminish as the seniority, complexity, and requirements of your roles increase because they are likely to be more high touch, perhaps need more interpretation or judgment calls from your recruiters to identify who the right talent is for your organization.”</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>In today’s fast-paced world, AI-powered personal assistants have become ubiquitous in helping us navigate our daily lives. From suggesting the fastest route to work to recommending our favorite movies, these virtual companions have seamlessly integrated into our routines.</div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>But what about a personal guide to navigate the complex realm of enterprise technology? The future of process optimization is closer than you might think, and it’s being powered by AI.</p>
  <p>Leading business software providers are making significant strides in embedding personalized guidance and strategies for enhancing business processes directly into the enterprise solutions that companies already use.</p>
  <p>Looking to grow your business? Streamline specific processes? Or maybe derisk your supply chain? Imagine the future where the software itself could tell you how to best use it to achieve your specific business goals. In fact, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2023/05/30/sap-wants-to-future-proof-businesses-with-ai/?sh=153760295df9">software providers</a> are hard at work embedding personalized guidance and strategies for improving business processes directly into the enterprise solutions you already use. And they’re putting AI up to the task.</p>
  <h2 id="realizing-the-art-of-the-ai-possible">Realizing the Art of the AI Possible</h2>
  <p>Your phone can tell you how much time you spend using it, providing insight into how often you tap into specific apps. But capabilities like these leave you to analyze and act on that usage data all by yourself. For example, if you’re scrolling for three hours a day on a social media site, your phone probably is not going to tell you that’s too much time, let alone suggest steps for taking a social media detox.</p>
  <p>Future enterprise software will be much more intelligent than this. Right now, you can likely tap into that same sort of data on how often employees use individual enterprise software solutions, or even how much time they spend on specific processes. However, it is hard to know what to do with these data insights other than wonder why your workers are spending so long processing invoices, onboarding new employees, or completing any number of other tasks.</p>
  <p>By combining your software usage data, existing processes, and business goals, AI will be able provide you with actionable steps toward better business processes that help achieve those goals. All this, embedded right into the solutions you already use. It’s this combination of human and artificial intelligence that adds the most value and enables your organization to become an <a href="https://www.sap.com/intelligent-enterprise.html">intelligent enterprise</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="creating-the-intelligent-enterprise">Creating the Intelligent Enterprise</h2>
  <p>Say your company implemented SAP Concur solutions to help employees book and expense business travel. For many businesses, processing travel expense documentation is not a core competency so the opportunity to streamline the process creates efficiencies for the business. Using AI and machine learning, SAP Concur taps years of expense user data that helps identify hard-to-detect spend issues and anomalies. That same technology powers <a href="https://www.concur.com/blog/article/making-impact-with-verify">Verify</a>, a self-serve audit function within the solution, that is then augmented with a team of human auditors to create great accuracy.</p>
  <p>The same can said about <a href="/2023/09/hr-flow-of-work-ux-evolution">generative AI use cases</a> that enable leaders and recruiters to create job descriptions and find ideal candidates or help employees find personalized learning recommendations to fuel their career progression. These efforts help organizations hire and develop employees at scale, creating a future-ready workforce.</p>
  <p>Or perhaps you need to anticipate supply chain issues impacted by incoming weather — AI can enhance supply chain efficiency by predicting demand, optimizing inventory levels, and identifying potential disruptions before they occur. According to McKinsey, implementing AI-enabled supply chain management solutions has already <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2023/11/07/how-ai-makes-it-easier-to-bring-your-holiday-meal-to-the-table/?sh=fc10e94404b8">allowed those early adopters to improve their logistics costs by 15%, their inventory levels by 35%, and their service levels by 65%</a> compared to those who do not use them. No matter the business problem you are trying to solve, the potential for process optimization with AI is endless and, combined with human intelligence, can deliver better results than either could independently.</p>
  <h2 id="unlocking-an-ai-guide-to-the-cloud">Unlocking an AI Guide to the Cloud</h2>
  <p>The future of process optimization in enterprises is an exciting landscape, and <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/AI-agents">AI is at its core</a>. Often, the first step for businesses on the path to digital excellence is embarking on cloud transformation. The futures of the cloud and AI are intrinsically linked. As business software providers embed the power of AI — such as our <a href="/2023/09/joule-new-generative-ai-assistant">generative-AI copilot Joule</a> — into their offerings, it allows for data-driven insights that are relevant, reliable, and responsible.</p>
  <p>If you have already begun a digital transformation in the cloud, AI can equip you to optimize your processes for cloud-based operations. Modern core business technology, such as SAP S/4HANA Cloud, serves as an innovation engine that enables you to take advantage of next-generation technology virtually without limits. In the future, when you integrate AI-enhanced software solutions with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, you will ideally be able to optimize processes from end to end across your entire software landscape.</p>
  <p>It’s akin to the way modern luxury vehicles can tell you how to drive in more fuel-efficient ways by analyzing all the parts — and their individual functions — that come together to move you forward. But good business practices shouldn’t be a luxury. As AI technology continues to advance, it promises to revolutionize various aspects of enterprise technology, creating a more connected, intelligent, and optimized business environment.</p>
  <p>The AI-powered guide to the world of enterprise technology is already here, and it’s taking businesses to new heights.</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>There’s great news for SAP users who enjoy the convenience of the Built-In Support tool, which they can access right within an application. SAP is now expanding Built-In Support into SAP SuccessFactors solutions as well.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In this interview, Gaurav Dabur, head of Support for SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central, Analytics and Integrations, gives insight into what SAP SuccessFactors customers and users can look forward to.</p>
  <p><strong>Q: What does this mean for users?</strong></p>
  <p><strong>A:</strong> In the past, if customers using an SAP solution needed to raise a case or find information, they needed to leave the application and go to either the <a href="https://me.sap.com/servicessupport">SAP for Me portal</a> or the <a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/built-in-support">SAP Help Portal site</a> for answers. With the introduction of <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html?anchorId=section_1255553798">Built-In Support</a>, users can stay within the SAP SuccessFactors solution and find the right information, which is based on enhanced search capabilities powered by artificial intelligence (AI). AI pulls the context directly from the application. This enables it to provide a tailored search experience that can recommend the specific content to best solve their issue.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">

        <h3 id="read-more-about-the-availability-of-built-in-support-for-sap-successfactors-solutions">Read more about the availability of Built-In Support for SAP SuccessFactors solutions</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_SUCCESSFACTORS_RELEASE_INFORMATION/8e0d540f96474717bbf18df51e54e522/29164d6c8e55401f816e15656d8c3377.html">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Our focus is to give customers a consistent support experience and help them get their answers more quickly. Customers can get direct access to support content, tools, and channels from <a href="/topics/support">SAP support</a> – right at their fingertips and with no implementation efforts required.</p>
  <p><strong>What will SAP SuccessFactors customers notice that’s different?</strong></p>
  <p>Let me give three key examples. First, Built-In Support can provide live recommendations and access to more personalized support content and the latest and most-used knowledge sources directly within the SAP SuccessFactors solution.</p>
  <p>Second, it also provides a personalized and guided support experience that can shorten the time to resolve issues. This means users can get their issues solved on their own without needing to wait on support. The feature also has comprehensive case management, which helps the user better manage their cases directly within the SAP SuccessFactors solution.</p>
  <p>And finally, users can really collaborate with SAP experts in real time using our <a href="https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/product-support.html">Real-Time Support</a> channels.</p>
  <p><strong>Why is Built-In Support valuable for customers?</strong></p>
  <p>Built-In Support helps provide customers with an industry-leading, harmonized, in-product experience that is available in many SAP products. Customers that use multiple SAP products can have a homogenized and harmonized experience across different applications.</p>
  <p>Within SAP SuccessFactors solutions, customers can now make use of the enhanced self-service options that leverage our internal, AI-based search mechanism. This helps provide more comprehensive, focused, and personalized search results. Customers can be more self-sufficient and can get their issues solved more quickly.</p>
  <p>I encourage users to explore the new functionality of Built-In Support and to take advantage of SAP support’s knowledge base and content repository as they explore the SAP self-service solutions. They can also read more about the availability for SAP SuccessFactors solutions in “<a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_SUCCESSFACTORS_RELEASE_INFORMATION/8e0d540f96474717bbf18df51e54e522/29164d6c8e55401f816e15656d8c3377.html">SAP SuccessFactors What’s New Viewer</a>” and this <a href="https://userapps.support.sap.com/sap/support/knowledge/en/3387335">SAP Knowledge Base Article</a>.</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>In today’s rapidly evolving corporate landscape, diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEI&#x26;B) have become essential in fostering a thriving organizational culture. SAP leads the way in leveraging technology to enhance DEI&#x26;B initiatives, tailoring user experiences (UX) to help meet the unique needs of a diverse global workforce.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Our team of <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/successfactors/growth-insights-research/growth-insights-team">organizational psychology scientists</a> conducts ongoing research on the evolving landscape of work, workplaces, and technology. This research, along with customer feedback and our commitment to accessibility for all users, helps us design solutions that can meet your employees’ needs and enhance your organization’s DEI&#x26;B efforts.</p>
  <p>Let’s explore five key ways in which SAP’s focus on UX helps organizations advance their DEI&#x26;B strategies by offering employees an interface that can address their needs in the flow of work.</p>

For example, <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2023/10/26/exciting-news-for-sap-successfactors-learning-in-2h2023-the-new-integrated-learning-experience-is-now-generally-available/">SAP SuccessFactors Learning</a> offers individualized, AI-generated learning recommendations that can prioritize courses based on individual goals, skills, and organizational objectives and categorize them into “need,” “want,” and “must” sections. The <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/succession-development.html">SAP SuccessFactors Succession &#x26; Development</a> solution can enable individuals to identify skill gaps against target roles within their career path and take ownership of their career development planning.</p>
  <h2 id="cultural-sensitivity-and-awareness">2. Cultural Sensitivity and Awareness</h2>

Our solutions can accommodate diverse cultural contexts, helping to promote inclusivity and reduce the risk of exclusion and discrimination in a global context.

For example, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/employee-central-hris.html">SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central</a> can enable your employees to record their name pronunciation and post it to their profile for others to access. This helps ensure colleagues can address them accurately and confidently in meetings. <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/performance-goals.html">SAP SuccessFactors Performance &#x26; Goals</a> includes cultural competency as a performance parameter, promoting awareness and sensitivity to cultural differences in interactions and work.</p>
  <h2 id="systemic-bias-mitigation">3. Systemic Bias Mitigation</h2>
  <p>SAP SuccessFactors solutions help combat biases in hiring, promotions, and decision-making. Our UX focus helps promote inclusivity by using non-discriminatory language and content, aligning with organizational efforts to help eliminate bias.

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Employee potential is at the center of all people practices as it requires assessing individuals’ skills, capabilities, and growth prospects. HR technology can help organizations make informed decisions about recruitment, development, work allocation, internal mobility, succession planning, and more. It helps organizations consider not only what an employee can do today, but also what they could be capable of in the future, helping to unlock the potential in their workforce.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To understand the future of employee potential, the <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/successfactors/growth-insights-research">Growth &#x26; Insights team</a> for SAP SuccessFactors hosted interviews with 57 HR leaders from SAP customer organizations and conducted a survey of 1,401 individual contributors from around the globe. The research focused on defining, assessing, and utilizing potential.</p>
  <h2 id="expanding-the-definition-of-employee-potential">Expanding the Definition of Employee Potential</h2>
  <div class="promo blue">
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3 id="read-the-full-employee-potential-research-report">Read the full employee potential research report</h3>
        <p><em><a href="https://www.sap.com/cmp/dg/employee-potential/index.html">Learn more</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Before an organization can assess employee potential, they need to define it. Across the HR leaders we interviewed, definitions of employee potential fell into three different categories: individual attributes, ability to take on a certain role in the future, and current performance. Most HR leaders struggled to find a definition of employee potential that their organizations would accept, understand, or apply universally and consistently. According to the surveyed HR leaders, an expanded definition of potential would give them a more comprehensive understanding of their workforce’s potential; enable managers to better understand, discuss, and realize their team members’ potential; and ensure that employee potential practices are more inclusive of all employees.</p>
  <h2 id="improving-the-assessment-of-employee-potential">Improving the Assessment of Employee Potential</h2>
  <p>The research uncovered many challenges in the process of assessing employee potential, including what is measured, how it is measured, and who is involved. The top challenge in assessing potential was rater subjectivity, or raters using their gut feelings, opinions, or biases to inform their assessments rather than the organization’s definition or criteria. Survey data from employees suggest that HR leaders should be concerned about this bias: about one-third of employees (30%) feel their organizations’ potential practices are unfair.</p>
  <p>One way that organizations can minimize bias in assessment of potential is by leveraging an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered skills foundation like the <a href="/2023/10/skills-based-organization-talent-intelligence-hub">talent intelligence hub</a>. The talent intelligence hub powers <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm.html">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite</a> and can enable organizations to better understand, build, and leverage the skills of their workforces. By understanding individuals’ skills, attributes, strengths, and preferences, organizations can make data-driven talent decisions and minimize biased decision-making.</p>
  <p>AI can also assist in creating personalized development opportunities for employees based on their potential. By knowing an employee’s strengths, skills, and aspirations, AI can recommend targeted training and development opportunities that align with their potential growth areas. <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/talent-management.html?video=c6c01178-6b7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b">SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace</a>, powered by the talent intelligence hub, can surface AI-powered recommendations, such learning courses, project assignments, mentors, and internal roles, that can help nurture and retain high-potential talent.</p>
  <p>Another challenge that was uncovered in the research is that assessments are missing valuable perspectives on employee potential. Our research suggests that managers do not know as much as they want about their direct reports’ potential. This indicates that the manager’s perspective must be supplemented with other sources.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>According to the HR leaders that we interviewed, peers’ opinions of an employee’s potential are rarely included – only two of the 44 organizations we worked with included peers in a 360-degree assessment of employee potential. According to employees, peers are a valuable data source and are as aware of their potential as their managers are. Having a solution like <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/performance-goals.html">SAP SuccessFactors Performance &#x26; Goals</a> can optimize this process significantly by using 360-degree reviews to help capture a more balanced and complete view of employee evaluations, including peer reviews. Using the 360-degree review forms, skills can be accessed and rated to highlight areas of achievement and opportunities for growth. The selected skills, together with their ratings, are then updated in the employee’s growth portfolio.</p>
  <h2 id="using-employee-potential-more-effectively">Using Employee Potential More Effectively</h2>
  <p>In general, our research suggested that HR leaders currently use potential data to make informed talent decisions in succession planning, career pathing, and performance management. However, HR leaders struggle to use employee potential data consistently across different HR practices. The talent intelligence hub can drive an organization’s entire learning and talent strategy and help use potential data more effectively. Organizations benefit from having a single skills model that covers recruiting, onboarding, learning and development, performance, and succession. With a holistic view of the workforce based on skills data from multiple locations, they can make data-driven <a href="https://www.sap.com/insights/what-is-a-talent-management-system-tms.html">talent decisions</a> and can more easily identify and utilize potential.</p>
  <p>HR technology can enable organizations to assess potential to make more informed and objective decision-making when it comes to talent management and development. Organizations that can understand and ignite the potential of their workforce will not only realize their business objectives, but also create a positive experience for all employees.</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>With the new generative artificial intelligence (AI) copilot <a href="/2023/09/joule-new-generative-ai-assistant">Joule</a>, SAP is uniquely positioned at the intersection of business and technology, opening up an enormous opportunity for economic value creation on a global scale. To help customers capitalize on this opportunity fast, SAP is also embedding AI and intelligent technologies in its customer engagement motion.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>“The value, relevance, and velocity demanded from a cloud leader extend to both the solutions provided and the end-to-end customer engagement. Industry research shows that by 2025, four out of every five B2B customer engagements will be executed through digital channels,” said Sam Masri, global head of Digital, Customer Success, SAP. “Our customers need to achieve the business outcomes from their digital transformation much faster with streamlined interactions, reduced engagement complexity, and robust tech-enabled capabilities that make the buying journey agile, personalized, and memorable.”</p>
  <p>With operations spanning more than 10 sectors and 80 business units across Europe and the Middle East, ONEX Holding entrusted SAP with its five-year digital transformation plan. For the 35 legal entities in its oil and gas division, ONEX adopted <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana.html">SAP S/4HANA Cloud</a>, among other solutions, complemented by <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/sustainability-control-tower.html">SAP Sustainability Control Tower</a> to support its sustainability strategy. In six months from the initial digital contact, ONEX’s digital transformation journey was mapped out and the implementation successfully kicked off. Such velocity was gained through digital customer engagement with about 90% of the entire process being completed virtually, through SAP’s digital hubs in Cairo, Egypt, and Barcelona, Spain.</p>

  <p>SAP digital customer engagement is executed via digital hubs, attractively located on five continents. The hubs are home to highly collaborative teams of diverse, digitally-native talent that help deliver end-to-end, virtual customer engagement services. By continuously applying AI and the latest technologies, these teams help drive our customers’ business outcomes at an exponential velocity while maintaining memorable and personalized customer experiences.</p>
  <p>“Our experience with SAP was frictionless and seamless,” said Waqas Butt, ICT and digital transformation leader at ONEX Holding. “SAP digital engagement gave us an incredible jump start on our digital transformation and removed all the lags you typically experience with a traditional, in-person buying journey. With the immersive, tech-driven capabilities, we had access to the demo versions of SAP solutions that had already been mapped to our KPIs, enabling us to experience what these cloud solutions could do for us in an engaging way and at our own pace.”</p>
  <p>“The best part of our experience was having immediate access to SAP’s 50 years of leadership in enterprise processes. We had SAP’s industry, solution, and value best practices at our fingertips, made available fast through digital modalities and powered by cutting-edge technologies,” added Butt. “Although digital, the experience felt more like we were seated at the same table with top minds in SAP who had profound knowledge of all the regions and sectors ONEX operates in, including energy, oil and gas, power generation, and even infrastructure management and investments.”</p>
  <p>Part of ONEX’s digital transformation journey includes the development of a new way of working, called “Digital Workplace,” focused on embedding digital approaches into routine business processes to gain efficiencies and promote sustainability.</p>
  <p>“Digital transformation is not a transaction; it is a partnership in which both parties need to be like-minded. When we finally shook hands in person with the SAP digital customer engagement team, we did it because we spoke the same language – we both understand the power of starting a digital transformation, digitally. We know we are in good hands on our path to redefine how ONEX runs,” stressed Butt.</p>
  <p>“The relationship between ONEX and SAP is a beautiful example of how virtual immersive engagements can enable and scale human relationships and interactions, not diminish them. We call this human-led, digitally-powered customer engagement with a mandate of ensuring that all SAP customers have the same path to success with SAP, regardless of where they are or when they needs us,” concluded Masri.</p>

  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>Building risk-resilient supply chains is one of the top issues CEOs are discussing on earning calls and in board rooms around the globe. The issue has gone from one priority among many to business critical. And CEOs are no longer just pursuing lower costs, shorter lead times, and higher quality.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Instead, they are recognizing the need to resolve supply chain disruptions in an integrated way, bridging the silos of various functions and going beyond dealing with supply chain disruptions as they occur.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Taking a macro-view is also something governments have begun doing. Just think of the huge investments to “bring supply chains home”; for example, <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-chips-act_en">€43 billion in the EU</a> for semiconductors or <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/04/17/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-private-and-public-sector-investments-for-affordable-electric-vehicles/">$100 billion in the U.S.</a> for sustainable energy. At the same time, diversifying supply chains and complying with new regulations keeps increasing their complexity.</p>
  <p>Companies take various approaches to these challenges, such as de-coupling their supply chains by building up costly inventories for critical components. Another option is reshoring or nearshoring, which brings manufacturing and supplier relationships closer to core markets, ideally in countries with similar political and economic systems. But all of these strategies come with downsides, including the cost of operations in globally competitive markets.</p>
  <p>At SAP, our vision is to embrace interconnected supply chains and optimize material flows — sustainably — with digital technologies. We believe in intelligent strategies to reduce supply chain uncertainties for the long-term by helping industries redefine their operations and by creating value chains that are more intelligent, connected, and responsive.</p>
  <h2 id="supply-chain-convergence-increases-agility">Supply Chain Convergence Increases Agility</h2>
  <p>Companies that resolve supply chain disruptions in an integrated manner bridge the silos of various functions such as procurement, logistics, or manufacturing. That’s how they can truly alleviate the impact to their organizations. Supply chain functions need to work in concert and extend into their ecosystem of suppliers. Even the most accurate supply chain plan is meaningless if material suppliers cannot commit to volumes and lead times. Through integrating supply chain planning, such as demand and supply plans with procurement collaboration, manufacturers have a much stronger strategic lever to avoid downstream shortages.</p>
  <p>At SAP, we call this approach <strong>design-to-operate</strong>. Our strategy is to deeply connect all relevant functions in a supply chain along end-to-end value chains and business processes. Going beyond the four walls of your own enterprise, into your ecosystem of suppliers and sub-suppliers — that’s the ultimate way to tackle supply chain challenges. In the case of supply shortages, for example, it is imperative to analyze the impact to the organization.</p>
  <p>With SAP Integrated Business Planning, <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2022/07/05/how-network-aware-supply-chain-planning-drives-resiliency/">affected production orders can be quickly identified</a>. Impacted customer orders and revenue at risk are visible and informed actions can be taken to mitigate any shortages, for example, by changing production schedules. The SAP Digital Manufacturing system knows immediately about the changed production plan for the next shifts and adjusts labor and resources accordingly. Logistics departments in SAP Extended Warehouse Management orchestrate the new material flow, <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2023/04/14/sap-digital-manufacturing-and-ewm-integration-using-manage-staging-2.0-app/">moving the right raw materials into production</a>, and asset maintenance activities are re-scheduled to adhere to the new production priorities.</p>
  <p>As a result, supply chain leaders who follow a design-to-operate paradigm are highly agile and can take critical actions quickly to deal with supply chain disruptions.</p>
  <h2 id="saps-industry-business-networks-a-new-paradigm">SAP’s Industry Business Networks: A New Paradigm</h2>
  <p>Entire industries are recognizing the benefits of going beyond the four walls of their own enterprise. Consider a car company investigating faulty engines coming from one of their production lines. Now imagine it can trace the failure not only to a particular batch of components from one supplier but then dig even deeper to identify faulty basic parts from the supplier’s supplier. Instead of having to recall thousands of vehicles, it needs to recall only a few.</p>
  <p>Solving problems this way requires a mindset for radical collaboration as well as technology for efficient, cross-company data exchange. <a href="https://catena-x.net/en/">Catena-X</a> is an open network that enables just that. It guarantees interoperability by defining common standards. The network is not owned by a single business and data providers keep their data sovereignty. For instance, they define for how long and for which purpose their data can be used. On the other hand, consumers can trust that data comes from a reliable source.</p>
  <p>SAP is one of the founding members of Catena-X, together with five other companies. Since 2020, the initiative has grown to <a href="https://catena-x.net/fileadmin/_online_media_/231012_1_CAT_007_List_of_Members_EN.pdf">170 international auto makers, suppliers, and</a> IT companies. Among them are Germany’s biggest car companies as well as many small and medium enterprises. Catena-X may soon become the industry’s standard.</p>
  <p>Naturally, the <a href="https://www.sap.com/industries/automotive/industry-network-automotive.html">SAP Business Network for the automotive industry</a> is ready for Catena-X. It readily connects Catena-X to SAP’s broad portfolio of automotive IT solutions to trace parts, measure carbon emissions and manage demand, capacity and quality. Recently, SAP announced business networks for more industries, including <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-network/industries.html">high tech, industrial manufacturing, consumer products, and life sciences</a>, with more to come.</p>
  <h2 id="generative-ai-adds-new-types-of-intelligence">Generative AI Adds New Types of Intelligence</h2>
  <p>A key tool in solving supply chain complexity challenges is artificial intelligence (AI). Even before the recent groundbreaking advances in large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, our supply chain solutions have been infused with both “traditional” and “advanced” AI.</p>
  <p>For instance, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/integrated-business-planning.html">SAP Integrated Business Planning for Supply Chain</a> creates demand forecasts based on historical demand patterns, but it also leverages advanced machine learning capabilities to improve forecast demand with point-of-sales data and improve planning quality using self-healing master data and lead time predictions. In the future, generative AI will enable completely new types of intelligent capabilities like these:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Facilitating human-machine interaction:</strong> Users will soon be able to interact with their system much more naturally via our new embedded <a href="/2023/09/joule-new-generative-ai-assistant">generative assistant Joule</a>. For example, they will be able to ask which of customer X’s demands for product Y are still unfilled in Central America. Joule will give the answer, intelligently combining data from various systems and domains because it will be embedded throughout the SAP cloud enterprise portfolio.</li>
    <li><strong>Supporting creativity:</strong> Much like a sparring partner, generative AI can help designers, engineers, and product managers create new product ideas in an innovation cycle and iterate them with SAP Enterprise Product Development.</li>
    <li><strong>Transforming unstructured data:</strong> Consider a truck arriving at a warehouse with inbound cargo. The clerk knows what cargo to expect and this is saved in an SAP system. However, what is really on the truck is written on a loading list, often in paper form. Making this data available digitally has been possible for quite a while and is known as optical character recognition (OCR). What’s new is that generative AI tools can now match the unstructured loading list to the structured data already in the system — in a split second.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Leveraging AI for companies to scale and sustain business operations will no longer be optional. Consider the increasing labor shortage facing manufacturing companies, among others. They will have a shortfall of up to 85 million employees by 2030 — roughly the population of Germany!</p>
  <p>By automating mundane tasks with advanced AI capabilities, we will bridge the human resources gap and enable experts to focus on what really matters: making data-backed business decisions.</p>
  <p>Human and artificial intelligence work hand in hand — it’s a duet, not a duel.</p>
  <p>We already help our customers build risk-resilient supply chains and deeply connect enterprises to run productive, agile and automated operations. Now, by also leveraging the power of generative AI, we will ensure that supply chain resilience doesn’t have to be something that keeps CEOs up at night.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>People managers have the potential to make or break the employee experience at an organization. They are responsible for understanding the demands of the business and motivating their team members to meet those requirements. However, the people manager role is evolving due to three crucial factors – hybrid and remote work, automation, and elevated employee expectations.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To help understand this evolution of the people manager role, the <a href="https://community.sap.com/topics/successfactors/growth-insights-research/growth-insights-team">Growth &#x26; Insights team</a> for SAP SuccessFactors hosted interviews with 31 HR leaders from SAP customer organizations and conducted a survey of 731 people managers and 716 individual contributors from around the globe. Based on the research findings, below are six ways organizations can improve current people managers’ performance and experience with SAP SuccessFactors solutions.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="utilize-co-leadership-models">Utilize Co-Leadership Models</h2>
  <p>Organizations look to people managers to execute important initiatives and people practices, leading to an overload of responsibilities. Implementing co-leadership structures, even for a short period of time, can reduce a people manager’s role overload and provide individual contributors with a valuable experiential learning opportunity.</p>
  <p>One way to provide an experiential opportunity is through <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/05/bc7c3ca3-727e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">dynamic teams</a>, advanced capabilities available as part of SAP SuccessFactors solutions that can help create and manage cross-functional teams that exist beyond traditional hierarchies. <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/05/bc7c3ca3-727e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html">Statistics</a> reported that 66% of employees who had participated in a dynamic team felt a positive impact on their career, leading to higher engagement. Using dynamic teams can help organizations utilize co-leadership models for projects while also accessing individual contributor potential and incorporating those insights into future succession plans.</p>
  <h2 id="update-people-manager-job-descriptions">Update People Manager Job Descriptions</h2>
  <p>Many organizations have not updated their formal job descriptions for people managers to accurately reflect changes to their roles, leading to unclear performance expectations and ineffective systems for developing and selecting people managers. One way organizations can streamline this process is through <a href="/2023/10/new-sap-successfactors-ai-innovations-successconnect">generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the SAP SuccessFactors Recruiting solution</a>. Hiring managers and recruiters can fine-tune job descriptions with generative AI, which allows them to incorporate supplementary content, identify biased language, and help ensure alignment with business requirements. Instead of starting from scratch every time a new position is created or requirements are updated, recruiters and hiring managers can use AI to help draft job descriptions faster and stay in their normal flow of work. And more importantly, the final content is more meaningful, inclusive, and competitive – presenting a clear and accurate view of the role to attract a larger pool of qualified and interested candidates.</p>
  <h2 id="rethink-career-architecture-and-pathways-to-advancement">Rethink Career Architecture and Pathways to Advancement</h2>
  <p>Without other options for growing, gaining status, or increasing compensation, employees will seek people management roles even if they are not suitable for or interested in this type of role. Developing alternative pathways for advancement, such as specialist career paths, for high-performing individual contributors ensures that employees are entering people manager roles for the right reason – to manage people.</p>
  <p>Sharing career architectures more broadly can also improve managers’ awareness of internal mobility opportunities, which they cited as a top challenge. Talent marketplaces, like the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/opportunity-marketplace.html">SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace</a> solution, can improve visibility into development and growth opportunities within the organization. It can provide AI-driven personalized recommendations for learning, mentors, internal roles, and dynamic teams. This allows employees to have experiential learning opportunities and can provide them alternate career paths.</p>

  </div>
  <h2 id="implement-succession-planning-for-all">Implement Succession Planning for All</h2>
  <p>Everyone agrees that people manager roles should become more exclusive, but that also means talent pools will become shallower. Implementing succession planning at all levels of the organization allows organizations to identify “hidden” people manager talent. When developing succession plans, consider that a people manager does not always need to be replaced with an existing people manager – and that a people manager’s next role does not always need to be in management. The <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/succession-development.html">SAP SuccessFactors Succession &#x26; Development</a> solution can make this process easier by helping employees expand their skills and advance their careers with visibility into continuous development dialogue, mentoring opportunities, and AI-powered career planning. It can also optimize succession planning, making it scalable to place the right people in the right roles and helping to secure the “hidden” people manager talent.</p>
  <h2 id="create-a-community-for-people-managers">Create a Community for People Managers</h2>
  <p>People managers consider staying engaged, feeling included, and managing their well-being to be top challenges. Creating a people manager community provides this crucial workforce segment with social support, which research has shown to be a positive driver of the people manger experience. This also offers the organization a clear channel to host two-way communication with people managers. One way to foster a community for people managers is to leverage the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/workzone-hr.html">SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone</a> solution, which is a personalized digital workspace that helps support and encourage collaboration. People managers can create their own community and connect with each other, allowing for more engagement, sharing of best practices, and improvement in the overall employee experience.</p>
  <h2 id="leverage-technology">Leverage Technology</h2>
  <p><a href="/topics/human-resources">Cloud HR technology</a> can help support the strategies recommended here and solve many of managers’ most pressing challenges. With SAP SuccessFactors solutions, organizations can put their people at the center of everything and create AI-powered experiences that can support current people managers while using talent intelligence to help uncover and develop the managers of tomorrow.</p>
  <p>As the expectations of people managers from both employees and organizations undergo constant evolution, the role of people manager will increasingly become more “people-centric” – focusing on support, fostering development, and nurturing a positive culture. It’s important that organizations use the right HR technology to deliver engaging employee experiences, increase productivity, and drive better business outcomes.</p>

Today, more than 24,000 of our SAP customers are using SAP Business AI solutions in over 130 use cases. And we are aiming to provide even more businesses the opportunity to benefit from our unique data, industry, and process know-how as we work to become THE leading business AI company.</p>
  <p>At the heart of that vision is SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP), THE platform of choice and key enabler for infusing SAP and partner applications with business AI.</p>
  <p>My keynote guest speaker Michael Nilles, chief digital and information officer (CDIO) of Henkel, said it well: “Generative AI disrupts economy and society like the internet, but at lightspeed. Look at the last 10 months only — I have never discovered an exponential technology like that. SAP BTP is our choice at Henkel for three years already; it’s our innovation platform. Together with SAP, we innovate at large scale, now also in the generative AI space.”</p>
  <p>To this end, we have been driving significant progress in the past months, from <a href="/2023/07/power-of-business-ai-sap-btp">SAP Business AI capabilities</a> across our portfolio to the launch of our generative <a href="/2023/09/joule-new-generative-ai-assistant">AI co-pilot Joule</a>. The <a href="https://www.sap.com/events/teched/news-guide.html">announcements made at SAP TechEd</a> are another testament to the innovation SAP provides.</p>

  <h2 id="build-in-not-bolt-on">Build In, Not Bolt On</h2>
  <p>We believe that business AI capabilities need to be directly embedded into applications and extensions. Designed with security, governance, and trust in mind, the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/business-technology-platform.html">AI Foundation on SAP BTP</a> is our new one-stop shop for developers to do exactly that. It provides ready-to-use AI services, AI runtimes, lifecycle management, as well as tooling for generative AI capabilities and business-data connectivity.</p>
  <p>As part of the AI Foundation, our generative AI hub provides instant access to the most powerful large language models (LLM), such as Azure OpenAI Service and Falcon-40b. On the other side, it offers grounding capabilities based on enterprise data to ensure context, for example, by leveraging our new SAP HANA Cloud vector engine that combines LLMs with relevant organizational data.</p>
  <h2 id="all-developers-will-be-ai-developers">All Developers Will Be AI Developers</h2>
  <p>Today’s dynamic technology and business landscape means every developer needs to become an AI developer. For coders using Java and Javascript, our new solution <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/developer-tools.html">SAP Build Code</a> increases developer productivity by offering a simplified experience with a unified lobby as an entry point, and generative AI capabilities. SAP Build Code also takes care of identity management, audit logging, secure access, and more.</p>
  <p>Does this sound too good to be true? Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&#x26;v=6BsvzygS5Hg">my keynote</a> to see for yourself how SAP Build Code helped to create a full-blown application in just five minutes on stage!</p>
  <h2 id="raise-the-ecosystem">R“AI”se the Ecosystem</h2>
  <p>More and more businesses are seeking to benefit from AI. No single company can unlock generative AI’s potential alone. A vibrant ecosystem of partners is required in order to meet growing customer expectations.</p>
  <p>SAP is partnering with many key players that offer solutions connected to SAP BTP. Today, partners support 90% of SAP-based implementations and offer 2,000 solutions on our store — more than 400 of these include AI capabilities. Moreover, our partner solutions also enable developers to create AI-based apps on SAP BTP. One example is our partnership with DataRobot, announced earlier this year. We now brought its AI models to SAP AI Core as well as its predictive and generative AI capabilities to SAP Build.</p>
  <p>Apart from the partner context, we also invest in AI research. The recently announced <a href="/2023/11/sap-joins-stanford-hai-corporate-affiliate-program">membership at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI</a> is an important step to reinforce our commitment to build ethical and trustworthy AI.</p>
  <h2 id="going-forward-looking-beyond">Going Forward, Looking Beyond</h2>
  <p>The future holds a lot. On our way to become THE leading business AI company we will continue to integrate AI into businesses’ everyday processes.</p>
  <p>For 2024 and beyond, we are exploring multiple use cases, such as AI-supported business simulations, AI-generated business correspondence replies and follow-up actions, composable business processes, or automated generation of code. We will also support fine-tuned LLMs to make them more suitable for business AI.</p>
  <p>This SAP TechEd has only been a first milestone — there’s a lot more to come! Don’t miss out on your journey to SAP BTP, THE choice for anything technology-related in an SAP context.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Last week at <a href="https://www.sap.com/events/teched/bangalore.html">SAP TechEd</a>, we announced new SAP BTP innovations that help organizations and developers bring their ideas to life.</p>
  <p>Thank you to everyone who attended the event virtually and in person at Bangalore. For those who couldn’t attend live, I recommend reading the <a href="https://www.sap.com/events/teched/news-guide.html">SAP TechEd news guide</a>, checking out the full list of <a href="https://go3.events.sap.com/sapteched/virtual/2023/reg/flow/sap/sapteched23/catalog/page/catalog?tab.sessionplanned=1602215152230002KZab">on-demand sessions</a>, and watching the <a href="https://go3.events.sap.com/sapteched/virtual/2023/reg/flow/sap/sapteched23/catalog/page/catalog/session/1692373933108001qRNV">executive keynote</a>, delivered by SAP CTO Juergen Mueller.</p>
  <p>Here are some of the key announcements we made.</p>
  <h2 id="turning-every-developer-into-an-ai-developer">Turning Every Developer into an AI Developer</h2>
  <p>Developers are essential to the modern world we live in, driving innovation and transformation forward across every industry. To help improve their productivity, we announced <a href="/2023/11/sap-teched-2023-sap-build-code-supercharge-developer-productivity">SAP Build Code</a>, a generative AI-powered application development solution, built on SAP BTP and optimized for Java and JavaScript development. It delivers a turn-key environment for coding, testing, integrations, and application lifecycle management.</p>
  <p>SAP Build Code has embedded generative AI capabilities with <a href="/2023/09/joule-new-generative-ai-assistant">Joule</a> to enable code generation to streamline application development. It also enables fusion development so developers can build rapidly, integrate seamlessly, and collaborate effectively with other developers and business experts. SAP Build Code complements <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/low-code.html">SAP Build</a>, our low-code solution that provides a unified environment to create and enhance enterprise applications, automate processes, and design business sites with drag-and-drop simplicity. <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/developer-tools.html">Learn more here</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="generative-ai-for-everyone">Generative AI for Everyone</h2>
  <p>More than ever before, companies are seeking to unleash the power of AI in their applications and processes. We are thrilled to unveil <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence.html">AI Foundation on SAP BTP</a>, a one-stop shop for developers to build and extend applications powered by AI and generative AI on SAP BTP. With AI Foundation, developers gain access to everything they need to quickly embed business-ready AI into their applications, leveraging the same powerful technology SAP development teams use today. This includes AI services, generative AI management, AI workload management, access to business data and context, and lifecycle management based on SAP AI Core, SAP AI Launchpad, and SAP HANA Cloud. <a href="https://sap.com/joule">Learn more here</a>.</p>
  <p>Later this quarter, AI Foundation will include a new generative AI hub capability in SAP AI Core for accessing a broad range of large language models (LLMs) from third-party providers. With the hub, developers will be able to use tooling for prompt engineering and experimentation to accelerate generative AI application development.</p>
  <h2 id="ai-powered-business-data">AI-Powered Business Data</h2>
  <p>SAP believes every data professional should have seamless and scalable access to mission-critical business data. To this end, we’ve announced new innovations that empower developers to build intelligent data applications with SAP HANA Cloud but also brings new capabilities that not only enhance the <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/datasphere/features.html#business-data-fabric">business data fabric</a> with SAP Datasphere.</p>
  <p>Good data is the foundation of good AI, and SAP HANA Cloud continues to pioneer innovation in the data space by adding new vector database features to its multi-model offerings at no additional cost. Vector datastores manage unstructured data — such as text, images, or audio — to provide long-term memory and better context to AI models. This makes it easy to find and retrieve similar objects quickly. For example, users can search for suppliers based on the language in their contracts to examine payment history and trace individual orders. These powerful new vector database features enhance interactions between LLMs and an organization’s mission-critical data. The innovation puts SAP developers at the forefront of delivering radically new levels of data insight within a secure, private framework that uses industry-specific customer data to reduce hallucinations.</p>
  <p>New semantic onboarding capabilities within <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/datasphere.html">SAP Datasphere</a> enable customers to deliver business-ready data products at an accelerated pace. With the powerful semantic layer, organizations can build data products that maintain business context and application logic and forego the time-consuming tasks of extracting business data, creating data pipelines and rebuilding data context that was lost. <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/datasphere/guided-experience.html">Learn more here</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="enterprise-automation">Enterprise Automation</h2>
  <p>Integrating, analyzing, and automating end-to-end business processes is critical in today’s digital landscape. To help customers stay ahead of the competition, SAP offers <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/enterprise-automation.html?pdf-asset=d237f8b9-7e7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b&#x26;page=1">enterprise automation</a>, one solution that combines the value of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/integration-suite.html">SAP Integration Suite</a>, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/business-process-transformation.html">SAP Signavio</a>, and <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/low-code.html">SAP Build</a>. At SAP TechEd, we previewed new generative AI capabilities to simplify creating processes and integrations and to recommend pre-built content. Deeper integrations across the three technologies helps companies easily mine non-SAP processes to better analyze, integrate, automate, and monitor business processes across their environment. <a href="https://blogs.sap.com/2023/05/17/introducing-new-capabilities-for-enterprise-automation/">Learn more here</a>.</p>
  <p>See you at SAP TechEd in 2024!</p>

  <p><strong>A:</strong> First, we want every SAP ecosystem developer to become an AI developer and we are rolling out new tools, leveraging generative AI, to help them build and deploy intelligent data applications at scale.</p>
  <p>Second, we are simplifying interactions between large language models (LLMs), enabling developers to implement intelligent data for generative AI applications. By expanding SAP HANA Cloud database capabilities with a vector engine, developers can combine the generic LLMs and gain the context they need with company-specific real-time data.</p>
  <p>Third, <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/solutions.html">SAP BTP</a> is the choice for infusing SAP and partner applications with AI. By embedding generative AI into our solutions and giving developers, partners, and customers access to all our technology and learnings through SAP BTP, SAP is the go-to partner for business AI and generative AI-powered enterprise applications. We already have 22,000 live SAP BTP customers in the cloud.</p>
  <p>Lastly, our ecosystem is critical for all our efforts to provide our customers with beneficial innovations for their digital transformation. We have 2,100 partners on SAP BTP, and there are 2,000 innovative partner solutions on the <a href="https://store.sap.com/dcp/en/">SAP Store</a> today. More than 360 of these solutions offer AI capabilities that drive business value.</p>
  <p><strong>Can you give us a snapshot of the major announcements this year?</strong></p>
  <p>Each of these advancements reflects SAP’s commitment to become the No. 1 generative AI enterprise application ecosystem together with our partners and supported by our platform, SAP BTP.</p>

It’s an exciting evolution of the SAP BTP low-code solution <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/low-code.html">SAP Build</a> that we launched last year. Our unified lobby of tools enables enhanced collaboration between citizen developers, professional developers, and IT departments. Developers will be able to create new applications or extensions for SAP solutions using our generative AI assistant <a href="/2023/09/joule-new-generative-ai-assistant">Joule</a> to generate code, create data models, and test data for applications.</li>
    <li><strong>New vector capabilities for SAP HANA Cloud</strong> allow developers to enrich business data with unstructured data including text, images, and audio. This is a unique offering from SAP, as customers will be able to combine the intelligence of LLMs with their business-specific data to provide accurate, relevant, and insightful responses. <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/hana.html">SAP HANA Cloud</a> is the database management foundation of SAP BTP.</li>
    <li><strong>AI Foundation on SAP BTP</strong> is our one-stop-shop for developers to build business-ready AI applications and extensions on SAP BTP. From ready-to-use AI services to AI runtimes and lifecycle management, we’re providing the tools developers need to manage enterprise-grade generative AI with security, governance, and trust. As part of AI Foundation we will also include a generative AI hub in SAP AI Core to provide developers with instant access to a broad range of LLMs from different providers.</li>
    <li><strong>Learning</strong> is foundational to SAP’s ambitious goal to upskill 2 million professionals by 2025. Our newly announced role-based certification for ABAP Cloud back-end developers will drive expert skillset growth for agile cloud business transformation. Moreover, we’ve supplemented the <a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-btp-guidance-framework/guidance-framework/what-is-sap-btp-guidance-framework?state=DRAFT">SAP BTP Guidance Framework</a> with a new <a href="https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-developers-guide/what-is-btp-developers-guide?version=Cloud">developer’s guide for SAP BTP</a>, which explains how to build and implement business applications on SAP BTP.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>How do SAP solutions help developers, data scientists, business users, and other professionals power their personal success and organization’s growth?</strong></p>
  <p>SAP is already at the forefront of generative AI advancements. Over 24,000 cloud customers are actively using more than 130 AI scenarios built on SAP BTP. We have the business data, processes, and customer relationships, and we believe that most business AI capabilities will be consumed in an embedded way.</p>
  <p>SAP’s unique access to business data and our industry depth — together with our foundation in ethics, data privacy, compliance, and security — mean that we’re able to deliver unparalleled automation and seamless human-machine collaboration capabilities to our customers.</p>
  <p>Most important, SAP Business AI is relevant, reliable, and responsible. In our trusted environment, people are creating relevant AI use cases in the context of their organization’s real-world business processes and embedded into their daily SAP systems. These use cases are reliable because they’re based on an understanding of both the business data and what it means within the business process.</p>
  <p>Finally, our AI is responsible as it is built on leading ethics and data privacy standards.</p>
  <p><strong>How are customers and partners generating business results from SAP BTP generative AI capabilities?</strong></p>
  <p>Many of our partners are pioneering multiple generative AI use cases with our support.</p>
  <p>SAP partner and customer HCLTech is using AI technology to simplify daily tasks like recruiting in SAP SuccessFactors software for speed and efficiency in finding the best job candidates. They’re developing a catalog of generative AI-infused processes across industries and line-of-business use cases. India’s Mahindra &#x26; Mahindra, which has automated more than 250 business processes in just three months using SAP Build Process Automation, has piloted two generative AI use cases.</p>
  <p>In Brazil, social enterprise startup SDW brings clean water to over 20,000 people. The company used SAP Build Apps to develop an app that speeds up field worker collaboration and analyzes accurate data to help measure the impact of its services against KPIs, proving ROI that boosts investments for growth. Henkel is co-innovating with SAP on its first large-scale generative AI use case, combining natural language processing, simulation, and planning to make decisions faster.</p>
  <p><strong>Can you preview what developers should expect from SAP’s generative AI vision as we head into 2024?</strong></p>
  <p>We are building AI capabilities, including our new generative AI copilot Joule, into our cloud-based enterprise applications. This includes SAP’s just ask feature in <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/technology-platform/cloud-analytics.html">SAP Analytics Cloud</a>, available in Q1 2024. We’ll also continue expanding access to LLMs in the generative AI hub. Watch for more generative AI use cases that will be released in the first half of 2024.</p>

  <p>“Today’s dynamic technology and business landscape means every developer needs to be an AI developer,” said Juergen Mueller, Chief Technology Officer and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. “The innovations we’re launching at SAP TechEd, from AI-infused pro-code tools to a one-stop shop to create generative AI extensions and applications on SAP Business Technology Platform, support the developers at the heart of the AI revolution and provide them with resources they need to transform the way businesses run.”</p>
  <p>As organizations aim to derive business value from generative AI, effective collaboration between professional and citizen developers is essential. SAP is launching the SAP Build Code solutions, which streamline cooperation with business experts who use the low-code <a href="/2022/11/sap-teched-sap-build-business-expertise-coursera-partnership">SAP Build</a> solutions launched at SAP TechEd in 2022. Uniquely built for SAP applications and the SAP ecosystem, SAP Build Code solutions offer AI-powered productivity tools for developers and are optimized for Java and JavaScript development. SAP Build Code also draws on the power of SAP’s new generative AI copilot Joule – the copilot that truly understands business – to further boost productivity, embedding code generation capabilities for data model, application logic and test script creation.</p>
  <p>Good data is the foundation of good AI, and SAP HANA Cloud continues to pioneer innovation in the data space by adding new vector database features to its multimodel offerings at no additional cost. Vector data stores manage unstructured data – such as text, images or audio – to provide long-term memory and better context to AI models. This makes it easy to find and retrieve similar objects quickly. For example, users can search for suppliers based on the language in their contracts to examine payment history and trace individual orders. These powerful new vector database features enhance interactions between large language models and an organization’s mission-critical data. The innovation helps put SAP developers at the forefront of delivering radically new levels of data insight within a secure, private framework that uses industry-specific customer data to reduce hallucinations.</p>
  <p>AI Foundation on SAP BTP, a new one-stop shop for developers to create AI- and generative AI-powered extensions and applications on SAP BTP, will further help increase developers’ impact and efficiency. AI Foundation includes everything developers need to start creating business-ready AI tools on SAP BTP – from ready-to-use AI services and access to the top large language models to vector database capabilities and AI runtime and lifecycle management.</p>
  <p>The rapid pace of technological innovation has driven up global demand for skilled developers – and SAP is increasing its learning opportunities in tandem. As part of a commitment to upskill two million professionals by 2025 and complement free AI learning content already available, SAP today launched <a href="https://learning.sap.com/certification/sap-certified-associate-back-end-developer-abap-cloud?url_id=text-sapnewscenter-prdteng-LSC-TechEd">new role-based certification</a> and free learning resources for back-end developers using the ABAP Cloud development model. The two new learning resources covering ABAP development tools on SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA are available on the <a href="https://learning.sap.com/?url_id=text-sapnewscenter-prdteng-LSC-TechEd">SAP Learning site</a>. They are designed for agile and cloud-compliant business transformation, providing developers with skills to build cloud-ready extensions that are aligned with SAP’s clean core strategy. SAP <a href="/">has also joined</a> the Stanford HAI (Institute for Human-Centered AI) <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/corporate-affiliate-program">Corporate Affiliate Program</a>. Researchers and engineers at SAP will work with the Stanford academic community, including research faculty and students, on the intersection of generative AI and business.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP) today announced it has joined the Stanford University Human-Centered Intelligence <a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/corporate-affiliate-program">HAI Corporate Affiliate Program</a>.</p>

  <p>By joining the program, SAP will be supporting Stanford HAI’s research, policy and education efforts to help responsibly build and implement artificial intelligence (AI). In addition, SAP will commit expertise and resources to help the HAI Corporate Affiliate Program explore the frontier of generative AI in business and how the new technologies will transform industries and economies.</p>

  <p>“Generative AI offers a whole new world of opportunities to simplify and optimize business processes. As AI evolves at a rapid pace, we need to ensure that it is developed with three guiding principles: relevance, reliability and responsibility,” said Juergen Mueller, Chief Technology Officer and member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. “Joining the Stanford’s HAI Corporate Affiliate Program reinforces SAP’s commitment to building best-in-class business AI that is ethical and trustworthy. The collaboration with experts in the field also enables a continuous exchange on the latest AI research as we advance our own foundational model and business-ready AI for companies worldwide.”</p>
  <p>SAP brings over 50 years of business process and technology expertise as a global corporation that is already deeply engaged with turning AI’s potential into reality for many of the world’s leading companies. SAP has been working with a large ecosystem of customers and partners to develop offerings across finance, supply chain, human resources, sustainability and other business-critical areas.</p>
  <p>“Stanford’s HAI has played a pivotal role in accelerating advancements in foundational models, particularly in the realm of AI safety and the consideration of this new technology’s societal impacts,” said James Landay, vice director and faculty director of research for HAI, Stanford. “Our faculty and student body look forward to collaborating with SAP as we aim to unlock novel use cases and develop new research contributions.”</p>
  <p>The opportunity for researchers and engineers at SAP to engage with the Stanford academic community, including research faculty and students, on the intersection of generative AI and business will also benefit the broader technology and business community.</p>
  <p>“A significant aspect of Stanford’s HAI mission is to inform and influence the overall direction of industry’s fundamental research and augment the human-centeredness of applied AI,” said Panos Madamopoulos, managing director, Industry Programs and Partnerships, HAI Corporate Affiliate Program. “We are immensely excited to work with SAP as it seeks to build foundational AI models with a human-centric approach. We hope our affiliate engagement will foster research collaborations across SAP’s entire AI stack — from development, evaluations and safety to understanding the economic impact and enhancing productivity.”</p>

  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>In the tech world, employee-created innovations need to blossom beyond the original innovator to have the biggest impact, but <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733323000124">new research</a> points to a puzzling phenomenon: employees often keep their innovations <a href="">under wraps</a>, limiting their diffusion.</div>
    </div>

        <h3 id="sap-business-ai-revolutionary-technology-real-world-results">SAP Business AI: Revolutionary technology, real-world results</h3>

  </div>
  <p>To me, the research clearly confirms the role of organizational culture in supporting technological and business innovation. Leaders shouldn’t necessarily default to an assumption that their team will openly reveal their ideas.</p>
  <p>The AI innovation trajectory from concept to customer — where employees are keen to step up and show their ideas — happens in cultures that incorporate psychological safety, perpetual learning, and empowerment.</p>
  <p>Leaders must promote global collaborative models that elevate the best ideas. At the same time, employees have an equally significant role to play in showing up for each other every day.</p>
  <p>The links are inextricable. Here is a bit more on what I mean.</p>
  <h2 id="psychological-safety-enable-fearlessness">Psychological Safety: Enable Fearlessness</h2>
  <p>Psychological safety is when employees feel comfortable asking for help, sharing suggestions informally or challenging the status quo without fear of negative social consequences.</p>
  <p>Strong foundations for exploration, creative thinking, and trying out new ways are laid in environments where people feel free to share and test their ideas without worry. And yes, failure is an integral part of every innovation!</p>
  <p>Celebrating, recognizing, and rewarding contributions validates the innovator and reinforces the innovation’s value within an organization. This is a to-do for leaders <strong>and</strong> colleagues at all career levels.</p>
  <p>Pioneering concepts can only be nurtured into meaningful solutions in cultures that embrace open dialogue, constructive critique, and allowing people to learn from mistakes.</p>
  <h2 id="perpetual-learning-follow-curiositys-course">Perpetual Learning: Follow Curiosity’s Course</h2>
  <p>With AI today, employee-driven innovations are central to <a href="">almost every</a> company’s success, no matter if you are creating and refining technology or applying it in daily practice. That means perpetual learning is now a non-negotiable aspect of <a href="">almost every</a> organizational culture, and <strong>people must be given an opportunity to put what is learned into action</strong>.</p>
  <p>Leaders need to clear away bureaucratic obstacles, point toward resources, and communicate through administrative policies that the door is open to learning. Dynamic team members must then take personal responsibility for pursuing skills that align with emerging business environments. Then, they must talk to each other about what they’re learning!</p>
  <p>Of course, technical skills are in demand. <a href="/2023/08/ai-careers-talent-behind-tech">Here are some ideas to get started</a>.</p>
  <p>I always encourage non-technical skills like communication, empathy, boundary-spanning, listening, and consensus building as well, because <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053482222000079">research</a> suggests non-technical skills are the secret sauce to driving innovative ideas to a faster, more widespread uptake of the benefits of business AI.</p>
  <h2 id="empowerment-within-an-ecosystem">Empowerment within an Ecosystem</h2>
  <p>Leaders need to consistently promote empowerment as a cultural norm. At SAP, we’ve found that there are many ways to empower people. SAP Experience Garage is a great example. Through the initiative, we’ve gamified employee experimentation and collaboration.</p>
  <p>SAP Experience Garage is a space where our people can experiment and prototype in collaborative spaces with the end purpose of improving the lives of SAP’s people and our customers. In one recent project, more than 300 colleagues formed teams to ideate and develop generative AI use cases for the SAP ecosystem.</p>
  <p>I’m very proud of the growing SAP Experience Garage community for unifying innovators and problem-solvers to share their experiences, learn from one another, and identify new opportunities that will create a positive impact on the SAP ecosystem.</p>
  <h2 id="bring-employee-driven-innovation-into-the-light">Bring Employee-Driven Innovation into the Light</h2>
  <p>Contemporary market conditions and the growth of business AI demands that leaders and team members work together sculpt, build, refine, and live out the values that build the foundation for organizational culture in a deliberate, thoughtful way — every day and across hierarchies and regions.</p>
  <p>With today’s pace of business and technology, innovation is often created on the fly, but must be carefully and responsibly driven at the same time.</p>
  <p>It takes everyone working together to amplify the human spirit of innovation.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="article-intro">
    <div>
      <div>The latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI have opened the possibility to reshape every business and brought new challenges. At <a href="/topics/sap-customer-experience-live">SAP Customer Experience LIVE</a>, I discussed SAP’s approach toward adopting AI to provide a delightful customer experience.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In the SAP Customer Experience organization, we focus on our deep industry knowledge and vast customer data to devise AI strategies. These strategies are based on <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence.html">three business AI principles</a>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Make agile decisions, unlock valuable insights with data aligned with business outcomes, and automate tasks</li>
    <li><strong>Reliable:</strong> Use AI that is trained on your industry and company data, driven by SAP process expertise, to tirelessly satisfy and surpass customer expectations</li>
    <li><strong>Responsible:</strong> Run responsible AI built on leading ethics and data privacy standards throughout our customer engagement process</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Using these principles, we are building and bringing AI innovations to market in two ways for our customers.</p>
  <div class="promo blue">

        <h3 id="sap-debuts-new-cx-generative-ai-capabilities-to-enhance-customer-experiences-and-boost-business-operations">SAP Debuts New CX Generative AI Capabilities to Enhance Customer Experiences and Boost Business Operations</h3>
        <p><em><a href="/">Read the news</a></em></p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>First, we are developing <strong>portfolio-wide AI capabilities</strong> that can be accessed everywhere by business teams through a common interface, including a standalone app and <a href="/2023/09/joule-new-generative-ai-assistant">Joule</a>. These capabilities, built on top of proprietary AI models and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), leverage SAP’s experiential and operational data as well as third-party data. The result is proactive, contextual, and AI-powered insights from across the enterprise, which help organizations optimize their business processes. These features will be available for purchase as a “package” with the ability to use only what you need.</p>
  <p>Second, we’re making our current products — SAP Sales Cloud, SAP Service Cloud, SAP Commerce Cloud, SAP Emarsys Customer Engagement, and SAP Customer Data Platform solutions — even more valuable by <strong>natively embedding new AI features.</strong> These features will be available within the products.</p>
  <h2 id="new-portfolio-wide-ai-capabilities">New Portfolio-Wide AI Capabilities</h2>
  <p><strong>Supercharge Catalog Management and Product Discovery with AI</strong></p>
  <p>With CX AI models, commerce managers can spend significantly less time on catalog enrichment and maintenance. Product attributes can be automatically extracted from images and textual descriptions, enriching product catalogs. Product descriptions can be automatically generated and published to a commerce storefront for an engaging purchasing experience. And image-based semantic search can help users easily discover new and existing products.</p>
  <p>These capabilities (available December 2023) will result in better product discovery, produce personalized recommendations, reduce time spent on repetitive data entry, and help increase cart sizes at checkout.</p>

  <p><strong>Automate Labor-Intensive Tasks with Curated Role-Based AI Tools</strong></p>
  <p>Service, sales, and commerce teams now have access to job-specific AI tools to automate time-consuming and repetitive tasks. Most enterprise tools can write generative AI-powered content. The SAP Customer Experience portfolio now offers localized AI agents to bring business context with hyper-relevant content.</p>
  <p>For example, when a customer issue arises, AI swoops in to create an overview of the situation and provide remediation guidance, for increased efficiency and a healthier bottom line (available December 2023).</p>

  </div>
  <p><strong>Retrieve Answers in Natural Language with Proactive AI</strong></p>
  <p>Sales and service teams will benefit from CX AI models that automatically detect questions and suggest responses.</p>
  <p>This goes beyond generative search. The SAP Customer Experience portfolio now proactively detects questions and retrieves answers in natural language. The answers are derived from business data, including data in CRM, various communication channels, various document formats, and knowledge articles. CX AI models powering these capabilities are trustworthy because they transparently provide the sources from which answers are derived.</p>
  <p>These capabilities will proactively identify and answer customer questions within conversations to free up sales and service teams to focus on more value-adding tasks (available December 2023).</p>

  <p><strong>Surface Customer Profile Intelligence in Context</strong></p>
  <p>With AI-generated customer profiles powered by real-time data from SAP Customer Data Platform, teams can effortlessly dive into customer preferences and deliver a more tailored and relevant experience.</p>
  <p>The power of intelligent customer profiles and insights is fully realized when they are personalized in natural language and surface contextually, prompted in CX applications. The SAP Customer Experience portfolio uniquely delivers this value through native data connectivity across SAP S/4HANA and CX in SAP Customer Data Platform.</p>
  <p>This means the ability to equip sales representatives to know when to offer the right discount and incentive to close a deal based on the total lifetime value of the customer (available December 2023).</p>

  <h2 id="new-embedded-ai-capabilities">New Embedded AI Capabilities</h2>
  <p>In addition to developing AI capabilities that extend across the SAP Customer Experience portfolio, we’re also embedding throughout our solutions AI that has the ability to do the following things.</p>
  <p><strong>Create Personalized Content Powered by Generative AI</strong></p>
  <p>Marketers can now use the new generative AI capabilities in SAP Emarsys Customer Engagement to create compelling content, such as subject lines and content blocks. In addition, with new AI capabilities like semantic search, they can quickly discover new products that deliver the right message to the right audience. For example, marketers can search for a specific keyword or a generic description, such as “items that are new in stock” or “best-selling products in &#x3C;a specific product category>.”</p>
  <p>The new subject line and content block generation allows marketers to leverage generative AI to create targeted, compelling email content that produces profitable personalization (beta available first quarter of 2024, with general availability planned for soon after).</p>

  </div>
  <p><strong>Generate Instant, Context-Aware Email Responses with Embedded Generative AI</strong></p>
  <p>Sales and service users already benefit from automatically generated email summaries and responses. Now, these features are supercharged with generative AI to be more contextual and relevant.</p>
  <p>Relevant and accurate summaries are extracted from publicly available information and SAP business data. With this natural language summary of contacts, accounts, opportunities, and cases, users can effortlessly sift through information and identify what is relevant. Email response recommendations are automatically generated based on the most recent communications with a customer, allowing sales and service representatives to engage with customers naturally and effectively (incrementally delivered in the SAP Sales Cloud and SAP Service Cloud releases).</p>

  <p><strong>Fortify Customer Identity and Access Management with AI</strong></p>
  <p>CIOs and security officers understand how crucial it is to secure their customer’s digital identity, footprint, and assets.</p>
  <p>The latest enhancement to the SAP Customer Identity and Access Management solution is an AI risk-based authentication capability. This feature is designed to fortify end-user identity data and provide an intelligent shield against potential threats across all our digital platforms and brands.</p>
  <p>With a unified customer view and consent profile, end users can confidently navigate real-time engagements, knowing that their data remains secure and private (available now with additional enhancements planned for second quarter of 2024).</p>
  <p>These are just a few innovations the CX team is working on. The next announcements I am very excited about are AI capabilities in the new SAP Enterprise Service Management solution.</p>
  <p>The shape, pace, and extent of AI transformation will vary from one industry to another, while remaining compliant with local and global regulations. We strive to build our products with relevant, reliable, and responsible AI that goes beyond buzzword-laden ambiguity.</p>
  <p>Using this AI, we at SAP CX are committed to continually providing industry-tailored, connected, insightful, and adaptive products that will serve as a powerful toolkit in your digital transformation journey.</p>
  <p>Stay tuned for more exciting updates!</p>

        <hr>
        <p><a href="https://www.sap.com/index.html">SAP SE</a> (NYSE: SAP), a global leader in enterprise cloud solutions, today announced new generative AI capabilities across the SAP Customer Experience portfolio, including SAP’s natural-language generative AI copilot <a href="/2023/09/joule-new-generative-ai-assistant">Joule</a>.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>These new capabilities will help businesses automate time-consuming tasks and quickly analyze data from across the enterprise to gain valuable, actionable insights that deliver more intelligent, personalized experiences for customers.</p>
  <p>Unlike other generative AI technologies that only utilize the data found in one siloed system, these new AI capabilities leverage SAP’s wealth of experiential and operational data, as well as data from third-party sources, to provide businesses with a holistic view of their customers. Proactive, contextual, AI-powered insights from across the enterprise help organizations optimize business processes and adapt to unique business needs and rapid changes in the market.</p>

  <p>“Putting customers at the center of business transformation requires delivering a strong, personalized customer experience with intelligent CX,” said Ritu Bhargava, President and Chief Product Officer, SAP Industries and SAP CX, SAP. “These new AI capabilities within the SAP CX portfolio will allow businesses to unlock their full potential, improve customer loyalty, solidify themselves as industry leaders and reap the benefits of generative AI with intelligent CX solutions that have a tangible impact on businesses. These capabilities are the next step in redefining intelligence to deliver a delightful customer experience, effortlessly.”</p>
  <p>The new capabilities, which include tailored use cases for commerce, sales, customer service and marketing teams, are the next step in delivering intelligent CX and enabling teams to work more effectively and efficiently. This will help ensure customers can deliver exceptional customer experiences that differentiate their businesses, create brand loyalty, deepen customer relationships and ultimately drive profitability. These new capabilities, which can be applied across the entire SAP CX portfolio, include the ability to:</p>
  <p><strong>Automate Labor-Intensive Tasks with Curated Role-Based AI Tools</strong><br>New AI capabilities include more than 10 CX role–based tools that aim to increase productivity and efficiency by automating routine tasks, leaving time for more nuanced aspects of business. For the service team, when a customer issue arises, AI can help summarize the situation and align the team on the problem, provide an overview of customer sentiment, suggest a solution and even track how quickly the issue is resolved. This step increases efficiency, boosting the business’ bottom line and giving workers more time to focus on strategic initiatives.</p>
  <p><strong>Supercharge Catalog Management and Product Discovery with AI</strong><br>Catalog health is one of the most arduous tasks for commerce managers. Items that are not tagged properly won’t show up in searches and incomplete product recommendations take away from conversions. Commerce managers can ensure high levels of product visibility and discoverability by using the new AI capabilities to review product tags and catalogs, generate and customize product descriptions and help guide customers to the right choice for their needs.</p>
  <p><strong>Retrieve Answers in Natural Language with Proactive AI</strong><br>Using AI to identify and answer customer questions within conversations will free up sales and service teams to focus on more value-adding tasks. For example, a salesperson might receive an e-mail from a customer asking about products. This new capability, intelligent Q&#x26;A, reads the e-mail, points out the important questions and gives the salesperson a suggested written response that includes the latest product information.</p>
  <p><strong>Surface Customer Profile Intelligence in Context</strong><br>About 76% of global consumers prefer personalized marketing communications, <a href="https://emarsys.com/press-release/uncertainty-us-shoppers-desire-ai-driven-retail-experiences-but-are-wary-of-its-use-research-finds/">according to a recent survey by Emarsys</a>, an SAP company, showing that it is imperative for businesses to have a 360-degree view of their customers. With AI-generated customer profiles supported by the real-time SAP Customer Data Platform, businesses can combine data from all business applications and surface these profiles to customer-facing teams. This holistic view allows workers to quickly understand customer preferences, enabling a more personalized and relevant service. If a customer reports a delayed delivery, front-line workers can use the AI-generated customer summary, which includes information on order histories, previous interactions and preferences, to quickly resolve issues and provide a better customer experience.</p>
  <p>“Organizations are looking for a trusted platform technology and AI partner which they can adapt and grow with today as well as thrive with in the future,” said Alan Webber, Program Vice President, Digital Platform Ecosystems, IDC. “SAP’s approach to connecting data across the enterprise, both in SAP systems and beyond, provides a foundation customers can build on for the long term. Furthermore, SAP’s decades-long experience designing business processes from AI can be leveraged to reduce AI’s time to value.”</p>
  <p>SAP is also infusing AI capabilities into existing products across the SAP CX portfolio with the ability to:</p>
  <p><strong>Fortify Customer Identity and Access Management with AI</strong><br>The SAP Customer Identity and Access Management solutions are debuting new AI risk-based authentication capabilities. These new functions secure user identity data and help prevent threats by gaining intelligence across all digital properties and brands. Users will have a unified customer view and consent profile, making data connected and adaptable for real-time customer engagements. Providing this level of customer data privacy and security is essential to preserving our customers’ trust. SAP solutions hold our customers’ most sensitive data, so we take this extremely seriously and it remains our top priority.</p>
  <p><strong>Create Personalized Content Creation Powered by Generative AI</strong><br>Using generative AI, the SAP Emarsys Customer Engagement platform gives marketers the ability to create targeted, compelling email content that delivers the right message to the right audience. The SAP Sales Cloud and SAP Service Cloud solutions will also embed two new generative AI capabilities: AI-generated summary and e-mail response generation will help users identify relevant information, have more effective customer interactions and ultimately deliver superior customer service.</p>

  <p>The <a href="/2023/10/new-ai-sap-successfactors-capabilities-ignite-potential">talent intelligence hub</a> is generally available with this release, providing customers with the foundation for AI-powered talent development and acquisition. Talent intelligence is and will be a critical component of SAP SuccessFactors solutions moving forward, with use cases for skills information being added across the entire portfolio.</p>

  <p>When organizations understand the skills they have today and the skills they need for the future, they can develop organization-wide talent development strategies. At the same time, talent intelligence enables highly individualized, employee-led talent development that gives employees highly meaningful and rewarding careers, but also drives organizations to where they need to go.</p>
  <p>AI will drive the creation of skills information, as each employee will see skills inferences in their growth portfolios that suggest the skills they may already have using data from SAP SuccessFactors Performance &#x26; Goals. This can simplify the process for employees and helps ensure higher quality skills data across the organization.</p>
  <p>With this release, the talent intelligence hub can drive individualized recommendations for employees both in the new integrated learning experience as well as in SAP SuccessFactors Opportunity Marketplace. But this is just the beginning, and you will see many more use cases for the talent intelligence hub across the entire suite in 2024.</p>

  <p>Recruiters and hiring managers can benefit from the use of generative AI to create tailored job descriptions based on data from within SAP SuccessFactors solutions as well as external sources. Additionally, interviewers can generate interview questions based on the candidate profile as well as the job description to help ensure they are contextually relevant. Interviewers are proactively notified within Microsoft Teams to generate interview questions, creating a more efficient and streamlined interview experience.</p>

  <h3 id="integrated-learning-experience">Integrated Learning Experience</h3>
  <p>Within SAP SuccessFactors Learning, we are unveiling a new, integrated learning experience that is now generally available. It features a redesigned, re-architected home page that can surface recommendations unique to each employee. This individualized experience helps drive a culture of learning by tapping into each person’s aspirations, motivations, skills, and preferences while staying aligned with organizational goals and priorities.</p>
  <p>Driven by the talent intelligence hub, SAP SuccessFactors Learning uses each learner’s learning history and skills within the growth portfolio. And with enhanced search and filtering capabilities, such as type-ahead suggestions and key results that populate as the learner is typing, it can be easy to quickly locate the most relevant content.</p>

  <h3 id="hr-in-the-flow-of-work-microsoft-teams-app">HR in the Flow of Work: Microsoft Teams App</h3>
  <p>With the SAP SuccessFactors app for Microsoft Teams, now available on the Microsoft Teams app store, we are bringing high-value, actionable HR processes directly into the flow of work. In this release, common self-service tasks, such as clocking in and out, updating location, or viewing a pay statement, can be completed directly from Microsoft Teams, helping to reduce the need to switch between multiple applications.</p>
  <h3 id="enhancements-to-sap-successfactors-employee-central">Enhancements to SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central</h3>
  <p>We are excited to introduce SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central quick actions, which can streamline manager and employee self-service. From the home page, employees can quickly complete common HR tasks, such as updating their chosen name and personal pronouns, while managers can initiate a transfer, promotion, location change, and more. These quick actions are also available in Microsoft Teams, SAP SuccessFactors Work Zone, and Joule, so users can complete critical HR tasks directly within the applications they are already using.</p>

  <p>The cross-system workflow capability is now generally available, which is designed to harmonize data and processes across platforms in a hybrid landscape, enabling increased productivity and reduced cost. This can empower customers using SAP ERP Human Capital Management on premise to more rapidly unlock the value of HXM with SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central while maintaining on-premise applications like time, payroll, and benefits – as needed – so they can progressively make their move to the cloud.</p>

  <h3 id="time-management">Time Management</h3>
  <p>We are introducing the ability for administrators to leverage employee time data to generate leave-related forms and documents, which can be e-mailed or downloaded in multiple formats. We have also enhanced the absence-counting rules framework to allow absences to be deducted based on different day types and conditions, helping to support unique legal and local regulations.</p>
  <p>We are also introducing new capabilities for auto-submission and mass approval of time sheets, helping ensure time information is available and processed in advance of a payroll run. To further enhance the time sheet experience, customers can now leverage a new business rule to display specific time types to relevant employees based on defined conditions. In addition, role-based time sheet alerts can now notify only the most relevant stakeholders. For example, late arrival or excessive overtime alerts can be sent to only the manager so they can address the situation separately with the employee. Administrators now have more flexibility to valuate time over longer periods, such as by quarter or year.</p>
  <p>Each of these innovations reinforces how we are continuing to deliver on our human experience management vision – putting people at the center of every organization. These innovations will be available in production during the weekend of November 17. Select capabilities will be in preview today.</p>

      <div>Thousands of attendees came to Las Vegas, Nevada, to celebrate the HR community, discuss what artificial intelligence (AI) means for the future of work, and share new ideas for how to ignite the potential within every workforce and business.</div>
    </div>

  <p>Indeed, from the mainstage keynote and breakout sessions to networking with customers and partners, AI was at the center of every conversation.

  <p>As the pace of technological innovation continues to accelerate, organizations face an incredible opportunity to explore new ways to get work done – ways that take engagement and productivity to new heights for everyone at work. Special guest <a href="https://go3.events.sap.com/successconnect/virtual/2023/reg/flow/sap/sc23/catalog/page/catalog/session/1695684941523001eAp3">Josh Bersin</a>, global industry analyst and CEO of The Josh Bersin Company, discussed the urgent need for companies to get on board with AI, emphasizing how AI can help keep companies ahead of the curve by transforming the employee experience. Bersin also shared ways to increase everyone’s knowledge and confidence when it comes to adopting AI, as well as the real economic benefits organizations can achieve based on early case studies.</p>
  <p>In addition, Julia White, member of the Executive Board of SAP SE and chief marketing and solutions officer, shared what AI means for businesses today and <a href="https://go3.events.sap.com/successconnect/virtual/2023/reg/flow/sap/sc23/catalog/page/catalog/session/1695684941478001eFQ4">how SAP is embedding AI into its cloud HR solutions</a>. She talked about the latest addition to SAP Business AI, <a href="/2023/09/joule-new-generative-ai-assistant">Joule</a> – a natural-language, generative AI copilot designed to help improve the experiences of everyone at work by making it easy for users to find information, get answers to questions, navigate processes, and complete tasks related to HR as well as finance, supply chain, and customer relationship management. She emphasized how Joule, with its AI-powered insight and assistance, can help organizations unlock new levels of performance, productivity, and efficiency.</p>
  <h2 id="talent-intelligence-is-key-to-closing-skills-gaps">Talent Intelligence Is Key to Closing Skills Gaps</h2>
  <p>The power of talent intelligence has far-reaching implications for how organizations can more accurately and efficiently evaluate talent across all levels and address skills gaps. During the event, there was a lot of buzz around the general availability of the <a href="/2023/10/skills-based-organization-talent-intelligence-hub">talent intelligence hub</a>, an AI-powered skills framework that’s built into the foundation of <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/hcm/solutions.html?campaigncode=CRM-YI23-HXM-2055448&#x26;source=text-glo-SAPNews">SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management (HXM) Suite</a>. Now organizations can have the power and simplicity of a single skills model to fuel everything from recruiting and onboarding to learning and development, as well as performance and succession.</p>
  <p>Sam Passman, vice president, Product Management at SAP SuccessFactors, provided a comprehensive overview of the <a href="https://go3.events.sap.com/successconnect/virtual/2023/reg/flow/sap/sc23/catalog/page/catalog/session/1695684941379001elme">talent intelligence hub</a>, including how organizations can better understand and leverage the skills of their workforce. “An organization that is not focused on skills is going to be left behind,” he said. “Customers often struggle with having visibility into their full skills picture and having employee profile data integrated throughout talent management processes. The talent intelligence hub is how we are making sure our customers can match the right people, doing the right work, at the right time – truly helping them become skills-based organizations.”</p>

  <p>Having a cloud-based HR foundation is key for achieving true HR transformation – the kind of transformation that makes data-driven insights, smarter decision-making, automation, and a positive employee experience a reality. At the event, Mihael Sutalo, vice president, People Technology at <a href="https://go3.events.sap.com/successconnect/virtual/2023/reg/flow/sap/sc23/catalog/page/catalog/session/1695672921270001Czuo">Pandora</a>, the world’s leading jewelry brand, shared how the company is digitalizing HR and adopting new technologies to create amazing employee experiences as a unified, global company. “We wanted to scale to future-proof the company, and we believe strongly in the power of the cloud,” he said. He explained how Pandora has successfully moved from a fragmented HR landscape to SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite, improving the company’s ability to attract and retain top talent.</p>
